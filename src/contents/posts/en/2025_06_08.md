# Practice Putting Things into Words

I think as a DS professional, summarizing findings in documents is a common task when working independently.

Not only sharing analysis results, but as a newcomer, I also run hypotheses before analysis by seniors first.

At such times, I feel we should be conscious that we're "taking up others' time."

Just like when asking questions, if your hypotheses or understanding don't align with team members, it causes wasted time.

Therefore, you need to concisely summarize what you want to convey and write reports where details become clear as you read through.

It's important to strongly maintain this awareness when summarizing.

Especially in analysis work, you want to create multiple hypotheses and explain in detail the parts that didn't work out.

Like: "I tested with XX as a hypothesis, but it didn't work, so when I tried YY as a hypothesis, it worked."

However, this isn't what the team or requesters want to know.

What they want to know is causality and whether it's effective.

Of course, to avoid repeating mistakes, it's possible to write about stuck points or failed analyses as an appendix.

But that should be an appendix, not something to state at the beginning of a report.

Often, failed analyses involve more trial and error, and I think it's human nature to want to talk about them.

However, what do seniors and the team want to know? What are they looking for?

I recognized the need to properly grasp this aspect.

This applies to submitting PRs too - reviewing means taking up someone else's time.

It's important to write PR request descriptions that are highly readable and understandable to readers.

This week strongly reminded me of the need for a mindset to review my analysis from a third-party perspective alongside the analysis at hand.


# Summary

Keep information the other party wants to know concise.

Leave it to readers whether they want additional information, so write it as an appendix in the latter half.
