# Won the Excellence Award

The other day, our team won the **Excellence Award** in the new graduate engineer team development project!

I was happy that our 3 weeks of development was recognized, and it was also a learning experience.

# Reason for Winning

We presented our developed app in front of evaluators (senior employees), who scored us on 3 evaluation criteria to determine rankings.

Our team was top in all categories, winning the Excellence Award without question!

I was in charge of the 7-minute presentation materials and delivery.

Since everything was evaluated through the presentation, I was relieved to have fulfilled that responsibility.

# Difference from Other Engineers

To be honest, our product wasn't overwhelmingly better than other teams'.

Still, I'm proud that we won the Excellence Award due to our presentation style.

I created my presentation to comprehensively cover the evaluation criteria.

The evaluators couldn't see our actual app.

They judged solely based on the presentation.

Therefore, if you present according to the evaluation criteria, it's easier for them to score.

However, other teams mainly focused on what languages they used, frameworks, what was difficult, etc.

That doesn't give evaluators anything to evaluate.

Create slides that allow evaluators to evaluate with confidence.

I think being able to do this came from being able to stand in the evaluators' position.

# Summary

The book "Zen" I read before was also helpful.

Use few words, appeal visually.

You can change evaluations through how you present yourself.

This can be applied not just to work, but to self-promotion.

I'm glad I dabbled in theater!

Everything connects.

Now, how should I work on self-promotion going forward?
