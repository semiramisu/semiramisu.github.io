# I Want to Touch Nature

Recently, I've been going to driving school on weekends.

During my student days, I was too busy with research and didn't have the opportunity to get a driver's license.

In the end, I was pushed by those around me saying I'd need it when returning to my hometown, and that I'd lose face without a license if I got a partner.

Driving has become fun, so that's good.

The driving school I attend faces rice fields and farmland.

Driving schools near stations fill up quickly, but those a bit farther away have openings, which is appreciated.

Moreover, in this day and age, classroom lessons can be done online.

I only go for driving practice on weekends, so it's a good environment where I can do weight training and meal prep before and after.

# I Want to Touch Nature!

I walk from the nearest station to this somewhat countryside driving school.

It takes about 30 minutes.

I walk slowly along rivers and through fields.

The cherry blossoms are beautiful, birds are singing, and the wind feels nice.

It's a moment when I realize I really love nature.

This makes me think about my current work environment.

I work from morning in an urban concrete jungle.

I knew this when I took the job, so it's fine, but the fact is I think this business could be done in the countryside too.

Tokyo rent is expensive, and living a bit farther out means getting caught in commute rush hours.

I still think that with IT business, you could live a relaxed life in the countryside.

So how can I earn an urban engineer's salary in the countryside?

I like the moments of spacing out while thinking about this and looking for business opportunities.

I want to achieve one result by age 30, so I want to believe that if I try 100 things by then, at least one will hit.

So my daily life is about thinking how to obtain what I like when I come into contact with it.

# Finally

kensuu's daily YouTube live streams in the morning are very helpful, so I recommend them.

And tomorrow is the driving school first stage(?) test.

Well, will I pass...

Every time I see those Japanese language test questions, I want a Turing or Tesla self-driving car.
