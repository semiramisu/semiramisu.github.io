[![Learn Strategy from History―――The Absolute Rules for Winners That 3000 Years Teaches](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PIaBQP02L._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/bPDIkiM)

Finally, with my resident registration moved and reading routine preparations complete, I've resumed reading!

From now on, I should be able to increase my reading records...

# Reason for Selection

Why I picked up this strategy book that learns from history:

1. I need to think about strategy at work
2. I want thinking tools
3. I just like history

First, what I must be careful about is that when learning from history, meanings and reasons might be retroactively applied.

Don't forget to maintain a skeptical perspective that perhaps grand reasons are only attached later because something succeeded.

# Learnings

・Can you recognize your own strengths?

・Do you understand environments where your strengths thrive versus where they get buried?

I felt these two points are things I need to think about immediately.

Honestly, I'm lost right now.

Basically, I've been trying to improve myself by finding areas where I'm inferior compared to others and compensating for them.

Recently, opportunities to talk with older people have increased dramatically, and I've been complimented more often.

Among these, I've been told that parts I didn't think much of were strengths, and I've been taught about environments where I could utilize them.

Both types of feedback presented aspects I had never imagined, making me painfully aware that the person who understands me least is myself!

In the end, without understanding my strengths and where they can be utilized or killed, I can't think about future strategies.

I'll start from here first.

# Acknowledging Your Weakness Becomes Your Greatest Strength

This itself has been mentioned in other research.

People think those who can acknowledge their weaknesses and talk about them to others are strong and respectable.

This was explained from a different angle through history, which was convincing.

Especially in this book about war, initially those who knew their weaknesses and could delegate to advisors or others more capable than themselves won.

However, when good results continue, they start feeling it's their own achievement and begin distancing others.

As a result, there's no one left to complement their weaknesses, and they collapse.

Those who can acknowledge their weaknesses, think good things are thanks to others while failures are their own responsibility, and act accordingly are strong.

# Leaders Make Decisions Only Leaders Can Make, Quickly

Right now, I'm a regular employee.

Of course, I'm not at the top of the company.

Furthermore, I'm indecisive and slow to make decisions.

While I fail less because of this, I've lost many opportunities!

And generally, I regret lost opportunities more.

The helmsman of my life is me.

In other words, I'm always responsible for my own life.

I need to "make decisions as the leader."

This means all success rewards and failure burdens return to me.

This contradicts what I said earlier, but all responsibility is mine!

I'll keep in mind making decisions as the leader of my own life!

Maybe I should change this year's goal to counting the number of challenges and learnings from them.

While I tend to focus on failures, if I keep challenging, the number of challenges naturally increases, making me feel like I'm accumulating something.

# Organizations That Pursue Purpose, Not Means, Win

Technological progress like AI and LLMs is remarkable.

There are people who can quickly adopt these tools and those who can't.

You don't feel inconvenience with existing tools, and you can continue without problems.

New things require learning costs and adoption checks.

You can make any number of excuses.

There, reconsider "Why am I doing this work?"

Means are just tools to achieve purpose.

If results come faster and better, you should adopt them.

This ends when you lose sight of the "purpose."

What is the purpose? What can be done for it?

Always keep the greater cause visible.

# When Fighting in a Niche, Thoroughly Optimize Guerrilla Warfare

This chapter might have been the most eye-opening.

What you often hear when startups raise funds from VCs is:

"It's a trillion-yen market"

And other market size talk.

Certainly, the larger the market size, the greater the potential profit (maybe).

But large market size means it's also a delicious market for major companies.

With numerical violence or business models that dig into initial losses, you might be drawn into a war of attrition.

If you have technological advantages to win then, fine, but without them, you'll be swallowed by major companies.

So, I understood the idea of targeting niche markets and not making their market size too large.

In the AI era, if you can run a business with few people, you can reduce human costs compared to major companies.

Then, you can sufficiently survive in niche markets.

After dominating a niche market, you might expand that market or target another niche market.

Start small and increase market share.

I need to think about what can be done for this.

# Finally

Honestly, there are countless strategy books, a mix of gems and stones.

Survivor bias applies, and reproducibility is questionable.

Even what was once praised like GE can later collapse.

However, it was effective as a tool to expand my thinking range.

For now, I'll start with finding my strengths and environment...
