# Company Expenses

I introduced Claude Code Max $200/month through company expenses.

Coding has become overwhelmingly easier!

What's especially appreciated is that I can freely use the regular Claude app too.

Thanks to this, I've decided to leave all AI tasks to Claude.

Previously I was using Cursor for coding, but Claude Code produces fewer errors, resulting in overwhelming time savings.

Especially as a new graduate assigned to new projects, being able to save time understanding code is huge.

I can decide whether to allow automatic execution of commands per repository, preventing destructive changes beforehand.

This time I modified this blog with Claude Code.

When loading on smartphones, images were too large and took time, so I fixed that for mobile.

I implemented the search function that was just decoration.

Finally implemented the contact form, etc.

I had it do many other minor fixes in just about an hour.

Since I can modify other projects simultaneously in parallel, it led to overwhelming time savings.

# Finally

I also added an automatic post function to X, so I'm nervous whether it'll work well.

Since it wasn't working well, I fixed it.

The good thing about LLMs is that you can solve problems immediately when stuck.

I can't believe the GitHub Actions permissions weren't granted...
