[![Upstream - A New Problem-Solving Approach That Solves Problems "Before They Occur"](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bpteMp6KL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/1L4zJID)

About the content up to section 1


Here,
Upstream: Preemptive measures to prevent problems (To prevent deteriorating public safety, provide comprehensive support from birth to enable people to lead proper lives)

Downstream: Measures after problems occur (Increase police after public safety deteriorates)

It is defined as such.

Furthermore, it showed that when dealing with downstream issues, 2.5 times that cost should be spent on upstream measures (Swedish example).

Additionally, in today's society, downstream work tends to be more easily evaluated.
(Downstream: Traffic violation enforcement, Upstream: Standing at accident-prone intersections makes drivers conscious of safe driving, resulting in fewer accidents)


So, what are upstream and downstream for me?

I think it changes depending on how you look at yourself.

For example, personal charm, earning money, health.

What are the upstream and downstream for each?

What comes to mind immediately:

- Personal charm

- Downstream: Wear cool clothes, improve appearance with makeup etc.

- Upstream: Train your body to stay healthy longer, train inner qualities like conversation skills and patience (hard to quantify, doesn't lead to immediate results)

- Earning money

- Downstream: Work part-time, work for immediate promotion, seek visible results

- Upstream: Study English, obtain certifications, start your own nano business, contribute to OSS

- Health

- Downstream: Go to hospital when catching cold, rest when feeling unwell, take supplements

- Upstream: Exercise, be careful about diet, avoid accumulating stress

Something like that.

First, downstream tasks aren't bad.

However, spending more time on upstream tasks than the time and economic costs spent on downstream tasks.

This can (perhaps?) change the problems that will befall you years later.

However, currently the time spent on upstream tasks is small.

Especially regarding earning money.

This might be fine now but will come back to haunt me in the future.

I need to think about how to constantly maintain this sense of crisis.


# Three Traps That Hinder Upstream Thinking

## Problem Blindness

Are you treating current problems like the weather?

- In my case, being swayed by crowded trains is stressful, but it can't be helped because of work.

- As an engineer, I can't help not understanding people's emotions well because logical thinking is required.

And so on.

But is that something to blindly believe?

A while ago, commuting = going to office, but now it's different.

You can work remotely while living in the countryside.

Why not do it?

Because I don't have the ability to work remotely?

Then am I taking action to develop that ability?

Let's change the design.

That things are this way now isn't my fault or society's fault.

The environment I'm in, the design is bad.

Where can we fix to solve the problem?

Why am I taking this action?

By changing the framework, think about problems from a step back and solve them with a broader perspective.

## Lack of Ownership

When problems occur, "Try thinking assuming you have full responsibility"

When something goes wrong, we blame others.

But for now, think that all causes of problems lie with yourself.

Global warming, Russia-Ukraine issues, Japan's declining birthrate and aging population, being swayed by crowded trains - all my fault.

This way of thinking isn't optimal, but it's useful for having ownership.

How to use that ownership?

Need to think about what I can do and take action.

For most problems, we think they're not our concern even though we could solve them if we became stakeholders.

Let's shift our chair, then we can see the screen we couldn't see before and the world changes through our actions.

## Tunneling

When trouble occurs and you solve it, it feels good.

It feels good to clean up a messy room.

But these are falling into tunneling.

To solve trouble, you focus on that trouble and produce results.

However, being so focused on it, you can't think of ways to eliminate the cause of trouble.

Tunneling can be said to be a product of extreme concentration in a sense.

Like work or homework that progresses at explosive speed right before the deadline.

But that doesn't fundamentally solve the trouble.

However, when you want to change the world, you can gather public attention at once or focus on problems you want to solve within the company.

It's about how you use it.

However, it's a powerful drug and generally addictive.

# Summary

Up to section 1, I learned about traps that hinder upstream thinking and activities of people who have dealt with them.

What to think about is: What are upstream and downstream for me? How to solve them?

Without being conscious of that and taking action, it ends as written words on paper.

# Chat
I often watch Niche Manju's luxury explanation videos.

I'm not interested in luxury brand products, but I'm interested in their management methods and marketing.

Among these, I thought maybe this poster might be a woman.

And that's when I realized.

I had unconsciously assumed that people making Yukkuri videos were men.

It's not that I'm curious about this YouTube channel poster's gender.

It was just a moment of coming to myself realizing I had such prejudice.
