# Experiences Only Available Now

At the new graduate welcome party, I received some valuable advice from a senior.

It was: "Explore shops and neighborhoods while you're living alone."

In your first year as a working adult when money is tight, you often live in small rooms or crowded areas.

As a result, the neighborhoods you live in attract various people and become chaotic.

In such places, you go out to discover delicious non-chain restaurants or find quirky general stores.

When living alone, cooking for yourself isn't cost-effective either.

So the advice is to eat out, refine your palate, and go drinking with people to enrich your relationships.

It's certainly an experience you can only have while young, and you can live in neighborhoods you couldn't if you had a family.

Thinking about it that way makes even somewhat difficult experiences enjoyable.

This is the kind of advice you can only get from people at a more advanced life stage than yourself.

It's really valuable to gain life philosophy through drinking and dining together.

I just need to think carefully about how to apply seniors' experiences to my own life.

Drinking parties are fun, but productivity drops the next day.

On such days, let's switch to working from home.....
