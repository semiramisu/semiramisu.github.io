# I Want to Make Nasal Breathing a Habit

When programming for long hours, things often don't go as planned, which can be frustrating.

Usually, it's because of some trivial mistake I made that causes things not to work, and such.

While AI reviews have helped reduce these issues, blaming yourself isn't healthy and won't lead to success.

Additionally, I often find myself mouth breathing.

I think this stems from past nasal inflammation causing congestion, and from mouth breathing when out of breath during baseball.

However, seeing people on trains sleeping or using their phones while mouth breathing made me think "I need to fix this," which brings me to today.

# Turning a Breathing Technique into an App

So I had Claude Code create an app that helps me be conscious of my breathing while working at the computer.

The breathing technique is commonly used for stress management:

1. Inhale for 4 seconds

2. Hold breath for 3 seconds

3. Exhale for 4 seconds

4. Hold breath for 3 seconds

Repeat this cycle.

The Github URL is above.

On Mac, I made it display in the menu bar.

This way, I can see the breathing guide when checking the date or battery status.

I also added sound so you can recognize the inhale, hold, exhale, hold phases by sound.

A thoughtful design for when you can't see the toolbar.

I had this quickly created this morning before work and used it throughout the day.

# Impressions

After spending a day conscious of my breathing, my mouth breathing disappeared.

I guess it's because my awareness is focused on breathing.

As a result, I feel like I also gained the benefits of meditation - two birds with one stone.

I was able to quickly finish my work, which included two tedious document creation tasks and some research.

Next, I'd like to use a camera to actually measure whether mouth breathing has really decreased.

# Final Thoughts

Creating handy little tools has become easy with Claude Code.

Thanks to my Obsidian tool that logs work every 30 minutes, I've discovered my most productive hours and when I should tackle creative tasks.

Additionally, using breathing techniques has made both my mental state and work flow smoothly.

I'm proud to say I'm successfully incorporating AI into my daily life.

I want to continue making my life more and more convenient in this way!
