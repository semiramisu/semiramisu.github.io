# Where Am I?

This morning I thought about my future.

At the company, there are awards every six months, so first I want to aim for the newcomer award.

It's important to make a name for yourself with a strong start, and it also becomes my goal.

In the midst of this, I had the opportunity to talk with a horse racing-loving senior from outside the company.

# Whose Words Are Those?

Recently, there are many business video media and consciousness-raising SNS accounts.

They teach us useful information and words.

But should we take them at face value?

Are we abandoning our own thinking by swallowing others' words whole?

Words directly become chains that bind us.

For better or worse.

A while ago it was "Buy MSCI World!"

Then "Buy individual stocks instead of MSCI World!"

Some accounts said completely opposite things within a short period.

You're free to believe either information.

But isn't it being used for confirmation bias?

In this age where it's easier to obtain information for self-affirmation,

And with increased online flaming, it feels like having and expressing your own opinion has become more risky.

# You Don't Need to Be Seen as a Good Person

People want to be thought of as good people.

So do I.

But you shouldn't lose yourself for that.

You always need to articulate yourself and compare with others.

No, actually you don't need to compare.

If you clearly understand your own axis, that's enough.

What's important is whether you can make judgments and live according to that axis.

# Finally

If you have an axis, you can become bamboo.

Let's live flexibly.
