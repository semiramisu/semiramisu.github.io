# Where Are the Evaluation Metrics?

Training again today.

Among the topics was goal setting.

I thought I understood that it's important to run the PDCA cycle for goals quickly and carefully.

However, when working at a company, there's something even more important.

That is making sure you can be evaluated by the company's evaluation criteria.

I had only been focusing on improving my abilities as a goal, but I want to be recognized for my efforts (and get a raise too).

That means I need to make it easy for managers and supervisors to evaluate me.

This isn't about flattery.

Where do my personal growth goals align with the company's evaluation criteria?

The fact that the company uses certain evaluation criteria means that's what they're looking for.

Developing those areas might seem like they don't directly connect to my goals, but they might actually be connected.

Improve your ability to set goals - no matter how hard you try at first, the granularity will be rough.

Keep improving the PDCA cycle for "improving goal-setting ability" and raise the growth curve!

# Finally

The new graduates I know in my cohort are rapidly becoming central figures among our peers!

It's good to have an environment where we can work hard together and inspire each other, and I'll demonstrate my value!
