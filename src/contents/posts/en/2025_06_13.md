# Can't Be Complacent

Recently, I've been having many opportunities to talk with HR.

Among these, I need to start moving toward the evaluation in six months.

Initially, learning the job is the best approach, but within that, I need to reconsider what career path I'll take going forward.

For example, since I'm in an ML/DS position, I need to think about whether to become a machine learning engineer or a data scientist.

Fortunately, my current department has both types of work, and I can choose based on my discretion.

Before joining, I was thinking of becoming a data scientist, but my feelings are wavering.

I'm finding it interesting to improve existing systems.

Especially in the field of machine learning, the fact that things actually work is also an interesting aspect.

As a data scientist, the image is more about analyzing data and supporting decision-making.

Well, I need to align my image of these jobs with reality.

In addition to these, I need to consider whether to aim to be a specialist, generalist, or manager.

With AI and LLMs emerging, I need to make choices while considering what role human engineers will play in the future.

Additionally, I have a desire to return to my hometown in Ibaraki and start a business.

Fortunately, my current workplace allows for remote work to some extent, so it's possible to commute from my hometown to the company after a year.

I need to consider both my desired professional image and family.

# Making My Own Choices

What strongly made me feel this was hearing about a senior I know who's changing jobs.

According to that senior, they felt left behind while watching others change jobs or transfer departments.

Indeed, when people around you are taking on challenges, you might feel anxious about staying in the same environment.

Furthermore, it's important to move before getting too old to take on challenges.

Being conscious of the age deadline for challenges and job changes, I'll work from next week onward being aware of what abilities I need to develop by then.

# Finally

Seeing seniors making challenging job changes, I deeply felt I've placed myself in a good environment this week.

Let's do our best from tomorrow too!
