# Am I Thinking or Just Wasting Time?

I've reached a point where I can't find good solutions for the task I'm currently working on.

This might be a common issue in data science, but even though I added features thinking they would improve prediction accuracy, the accuracy hasn't changed much.

I'm on a journey to find solutions to this problem.

This work involves what's called feature engineering, and I've gotten lost in the maze there.

After trying the methods that immediately came to mind, I don't know what to do next.

Intuitively, adding feature A should improve accuracy, but it doesn't.

I'm wondering what the cause is and what I should do.

The key to this problem lies in the data volume.

Since I'm handling massive amounts of data, using it incorrectly causes memory pressure and errors.

However, when I narrow down the data, the sample size becomes insufficient and doesn't produce good accuracy.

Intuitively it should work, but it doesn't.

Here I'll summarize my thoughts while stuck in this swamp.

# A Fool's Thinking is Like Resting

In a sense, encountering situations like this is exactly when a DS's job begins.

In extreme terms, you can have AI write analysis SQL, and the job is interpreting this data and extracting value from it.

Thinking about it that way, you could say the real work has finally begun.

Additionally, my current work differs from graduate school.

Therefore, I need to read new papers.

I don't yet have a stock of problems and their associated methods or journals.

Today made me acutely aware of the need to build this reserve before hitting problems.

You're free to worry, but you must worry in a way that leads to results.

That's what I felt acutely today.

# Finally

Create fundamentals to return to when stuck!

I deeply felt the importance of this.
