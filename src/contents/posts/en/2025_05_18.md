# Cursor (AI) is Amazing

About three days have passed since I significantly changed this blog's UI.

Originally, I was using a template I found online with some nice modifications.

However, I lacked the frontend knowledge to change it to my preferred UI.

So I tried using an AI editor called Cursor to change the UI.

Cursor is an AI-powered editor that helps with code completion, refactoring, bug fixes, and more.

In reality, I asked it to do almost all the code modifications.

It took about 3 hours to get the blog to its current form.

Due to increased image display, loading times have become longer.

While I'll improve this another time, using AI allowed me to get closer to my envisioned UI.

Conversely, this means that with motivation, you can create a decent web service.

Just convey your envisioned UI to AI, and it will write the code for you.

For personal use, there's no problem, but for commercial services, I think the importance of knowledge about security, databases, and safety has increased.

Well, AI might handle those aspects too eventually.

When that happens, what's needed is the ability to clarify what you want to do.

You could call it questioning ability or future imagination power.

I vaguely think that acquiring this problem-discovery ability is essential for future entrepreneurs.

Going forward, I plan to advance my learning of cloud services like AWS and actually try using them.


# Summary

Cursor Pro is an AI editor available for $20 per month.

It's impressive that you can do this much for about 3,000 yen.

On the other hand, from the perspective of companies paying high salaries to engineers, an era might come where engineers face layoffs or aren't hired in large numbers.

While using AI, we need the ability to identify AI's weak areas and consider the direction of skill development.
