# Train Delays

The other day, my commuter train was severely delayed, and I ended up standing for 3 hours straight.

Since I work at a standing desk during work hours anyway, standing itself wasn't a problem.

But what concerned me at that time was, "What should I do now?"

Fortunately, I had assigned reading on Kindle as my commuting task, so there was no issue.

What I felt at this moment was: Have you decided on procedures for when you fall into unexpected situations beyond your control?

This was its importance.

While it's better if delays don't happen, they're not something I can eliminate through my own efforts.

There are two measures I can take:

1. Take trains early enough that delays are unlikely

2. Decide on actions for unexpected situations

For commuting, if I take trains around 5 AM, there are fewer people, so the possibility of delays decreases.

Since work has flex time, I have flexibility with timing - it's just a matter of whether I can wake up.

The second is deciding what to do during delays.

This time I had the second measure in place, but it made me strongly think about reviewing whether there are other foreseeable unexpected situations.

# Finally

It's getting hot, and I've been thinking lately that I need to practice sweating.

Personally, since I started wearing shirts containing washi paper from Underson Underson, I've become comfortable, and I'll get through this summer with these shirts.
