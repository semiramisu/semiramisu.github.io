# Assignment Decided!

Training ended last week, and starting next week I'll be working hard at my assigned department.

Until now, I've just been completing given tasks.

From here on, I need to think about what I want to do and how to contribute to the business.

I heard some helpful approaches for this, so I'll summarize them here.

# Work Backward from Goals

When working at a company, there are people at various decision-making layers.

Business managers, engineering managers, team managers, and myself.

When seeking evaluation, you need to consider the current direction of the company and business.

- Business purpose, strategy, tactics

- Team purpose, strategy, tactics based on the business

- Individual purpose, strategy, tactics based on the team

It flows down from top to bottom.

At this time, you need to understand the business and break it down to the individual level.

There's no point in setting self-centered goals.

# Business Phase

This means you need to understand the business phase.

- Startup phase

- Growth phase

- Maturity phase

The results and work content required of engineers change depending on each phase.

In the startup phase: speed and verification

In the growth phase: feature additions and stable service

In the maturity phase: cost reduction and maintenance

Understanding your business phase clarifies what's required.

Working backward from there:

- What's needed for team contribution?

- What can I do with my current abilities?

- What's needed to improve lacking areas?

- What's the first step?

Break it down like this.

# In My Case

I can't talk about the business, so I'll return to personal matters for now.

I'm currently working in Tokyo.

However, since rent is high and there are many people, I'm considering returning to my hometown.

Looking at it this way, I see two paths:

- Be recognized enough at my current company to work completely online

- Start a business in my hometown

Given my work content, there might not be jobs in my hometown (I haven't properly researched), so starting a business becomes an option.

In that case, I should take on challenges at my current company that I can attempt with relatively no risk.

What challenges should I take to create value from data?

I'll set tentative goals within a week of starting next week.

First, I need to be able to extract value by looking at data from 10 different positions and perspectives...

It's not clear yet, but I'll set clear, quantifiable goals so I can look back later.

# Summary

With my assignment decided, I need to actively take on work and produce results.

Let's think of everything as my own business and continue reflecting.
