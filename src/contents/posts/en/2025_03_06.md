## What I Learned
- Having a "long-term perspective"
- Being aware of the limits of science

These two points were my major takeaways.

### Having a "Long-term Perspective"
A long-term perspective is especially necessary for engineers living in turbulent times.

There's talk that about 20% of coding has already been replaced by the development of generative AI.

In fact, when I'm coding myself, there are many parts that are faster to delegate to AI.

In such an environment, what abilities should engineers develop?

What abilities or fields that interest me should I combine with my engineering skills?

There are moments when I become so focused on immediate tasks that I lose sight of the bigger picture.

In my future projections, I anticipate that the value of being an engineer with a better salary than peers in other professions will decrease—in other words, salaries will decline.

When everyone can program using natural language, won't the market value of engineers become lower than it is now?

At that time, what value can I provide, having only done research at university?

Do I have any abilities as a person?

I've been tall with decent athletic ability since childhood. But is there a way to leverage this after becoming a working adult? I haven't found one yet.

Rather, wouldn't it be better to improve soft skills like being "interesting and fun," which are harder for AI to replace?

To begin with, if I think with a "long-term perspective," what does my life plan look like?

The more I think about it, the more I feel that I can't survive without growing every day.

I'm grateful that I could have this kind of self-reflection.


### Being Aware of the Limits of Science

Categorizing into "problems that can be solved" and "problems that cannot be solved."

This was exactly the wall I hit when working as an intern for prospective employees.

- Problems that just need research
- Problems better solved by asking people than researching
- Problems that cannot be solved with current technology

How quickly I can distinguish between these three and run the PDCA cycle determines my output volume.

More output increases the possibility of achieving good results.

I'm a perfectionist who tends to see "not knowing" as shameful.
So I've mechanically decided to ask someone if I can't find a foothold after 5 minutes of research, but it takes courage.

This connects to science not being omnipotent.

What science can prove is merely the act of inferring from past information and building up what's "most likely."

Therefore, it's difficult to determine the probability of something that has never happened before.

Furthermore, "99% probability of occurring" also means "1% probability of not occurring."

Even if I understand this numerically, could I process my emotions cleanly when actually encountering it?

I need to re-study "statistics" and "biases, emotions."


### Earthquakes

I'll be working in Tokyo from April. Considering my remaining lifetime:
- Tokyo Metropolitan Earthquake
- Nankai Trough
- Mt. Fuji Eruption

I'll likely be forced to participate in these three earth events.

At that time, I'll probably become unable to return home, and depending on the case, I might be forcibly terminated by one of these events.

Fortunately, I survived the Great East Japan Earthquake, but not because I had taken any particular measures.

I was simply "lucky."

Let's always prepare for the remaining three events + α:

- Secure furniture and PCs at home and work
- Memorize evacuation routes
- Keep nothing in the bedroom

Now, how much can I level up and upgrade my equipment before these three mandatory events...


# Finally

Professor Kamata Hiroki's books not only explain earthquake mechanisms but also show us how to live as human beings.

This is probably because the professor's perspective is within the large, long cycle of the Earth.

As written in this book, you can achieve the same thing through experiences like traveling and encountering people and cultures from other countries and regions.

The weak yen is tough, but I'd like to get a paper accepted at an international conference and go abroad on expenses.

### Small Talk
I had ChatGPT proofread this article.


``` text
'Chapter Score: 75/100
The text itself has very deep insights and is worth reading. However, it has too much "spoken language" overall and some parts where the logical flow is ambiguous, so organizing it more would make it easier to convey.

Improvement Points
Organize the flow of sentences

There are parts where the subject becomes ambiguous midway, and it would be better to clarify. Especially be conscious of connections between sentences like "The market value of engineers will decrease" → "So how do I increase my value at that time?"
Balance between "spoken language" and "written language"

For example, expressions like "what is it?" "wouldn't it be good?" could be more formal to tighten the overall text.
"The more I think about it, the more I feel that I can't survive without growing every day."
→ "When I contemplate these thoughts, I keenly realize that continuous growth is essential."
Use line breaks and paragraphs appropriately

Some parts have long sentences, and adding appropriate line breaks would improve readability.
Unify bullet points

There are places where full-width spaces appear after "-" in bullet points like "- Nankai Trough". Unifying these would be good.
Make expressions more logical

"I'll be working in Tokyo from April. Considering my remaining lifetime~"
→ "I'm scheduled to work in Tokyo from April. Considering my life timeline~" etc., to smooth logical connections.
Summary
The content itself is excellent, and the insights on "long-term perspective" and "limits of science" are particularly interesting. However, considering readability, organizing the flow of sentences more and increasing formal expressions would make it even better.'
