# Have I Used My Full Potential?

The other day, I went to see ink paintings.

I go to art exhibitions, calligraphy exhibitions, and theater performances quite often, and I usually enjoy viewing them.

This time with the ink paintings too,

・What materials were used to make the green and red colors?
・To create the differences in shade, did they prepare ink with different densities?

I viewed them while having various thoughts like these.

Among them, one thing bothered me.



**Is my work and activities so far something I can proudly tell people about, something that will remain for posterity like these paintings?**

# Work That Remains and Work That Doesn't

In my case, I often fall into this kind of thinking when I'm in a mild depressive period.

I enter depressive periods when I don't have something to be passionate about, and I usually try to do muscle training or running for about 3 hours a day before entering a depressive period.

Then, with the feeling of my body changing and being able to sleep soundly at night from fatigue, I can avoid the depressive period.

Right now I'm resting due to overwork, so I couldn't avoid the depressive period.

However, thinking about the future during this period often leads me in good directions, so I've decided to face myself during these depressive periods.

And I absolutely don't look at social media.

I know that seeing other people's bright posts makes me feel even more depressed.


Let's get back to the topic.

**Will my activities remain for posterity?**

When I'm spacing out, days pass quickly.

Since I started writing this blog, I've come to think that I must input something and output it, and my use of time has become less lazy.

On the other hand, when asked if I'm doing something I can be proud of, something that's uniquely me, I have trouble answering.

I'm accumulating knowledge but not expressing it.

My goal is to use IT to work without being bound by location or time.

It's too vague.

Using this depressive period, I want to face:

1. What do I want to do?
2. What actions can I take for that?
3. How can I continue those actions?

These three points.


Personally, since I've been doing research using AI and LLMs, I'd like to start a startup combining this with rural social issues, ocean waste, and health.

I'm also thinking about showing up at VC and entrepreneur communities to get some ideas and motivation.

Finally, words from my favorite fighter, Shinya Aoki:

**If an ordinary person reads the room, they'll really become just air**

Tomorrow, I'll live again
