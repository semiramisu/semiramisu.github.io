# SQL

Today, I had lectures and practice around SQL.

Unlike research, we're working across several web services from data collection to retrieval.

Therefore, we need SQL knowledge to retrieve data between these services and to effectively get that data.

In particular, we need to think about how to effectively retrieve data when we encounter unexpected data formats (like timestamps).

What I felt here was: "When you get stuck, where do you start looking for clues? You need the ability to do that."

I felt this area is difficult to solve immediately with AI.

That's because there's data that can't be included even if APIs are said not to be used for training.

Furthermore, we need to effectively organize the overall picture of the data and how we want to utilize it.

I felt that the ability to find clues to solve "I don't understand" is necessary both as an ML/DS engineer and as a working professional.

# Problem-Solving Skills

In this case, first and foremost: documentation.

First, check the documentation to see if there's any issue with this SQL statement.

Also, develop an eye for parts that might cause errors (timestamps).

While you can only learn this intuition through repeated practice, I plan to get familiar by solving tutorials.

# Finally

When you get stuck, can you gain learning that connects to the future?

Keep it organized in the form of documentation!

# Small Talk

When I tried keeping my Apple Watch display always on, it was really convenient.

It's helpful to see the remaining time during workout intervals without having to tap.
