# Two Types of Insufficient Understanding

I've been given tasks for business understanding.

Analysis tasks befitting a data scientist.

Through analysis, I'm learning data understanding and basic knowledge of data analysis.

In the midst of this, I'm facing two types of insufficient understanding.

Lack of SQL skills and lack of domain knowledge.

For domain knowledge, there's no choice but to gradually understand the data.

It's not something that can be achieved in one leap.

On the other hand, SQL is something I can work on.

I had absolutely no opportunity to use SQL in research, only minimal exposure in classes.

Therefore, I can't distinguish whether my inability to extract data well is due to insufficient data understanding or simply lack of SQL skills.

Being too self-deprecating won't lead to growth, so I've been changing all my recent internal monologue to what Paleo-san suggested: "What do I know now?" "What can I control?"

As mentioned in the book "Chatter," internal monologue can amplify your anxiety.

So I'm conscious of internal repetition that promotes positive actions for myself.

Applying this, what I know now is that I lack SQL ability.

What I can control is studying SQL.

I'm focusing on this and studying.


# How to Use Generative AI

In this process, I'm also using generative AI for SQL review.

I'm running an LLM locally with some knowledge added.

I'm only passing column names and demo data, eliminating the risk of data leakage.

What I felt in this process was verbalization.

I must clearly state what numbers are in the columns and what I want to know.

Without understanding the data, I can't verbalize it, and the LLM gives random answers.

LLM utilization comes with self-understanding, which further motivates me.

# Finally

Verbalization confirms understanding.

Without both understanding sufficient for verbalization and verbalization ability, you can't build reproducible, accumulative knowledge and experience.
