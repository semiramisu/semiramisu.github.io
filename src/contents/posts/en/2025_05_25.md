# Taking the Plunge

I finally purchased the leather jacket I've been wanting.

I made quite a big purchase.

Making a big purchase both motivates me and makes me feel I made a good buy.

A Japanese manufacturer that doesn't advertise.

Thanks to that, I could purchase a good quality leather jacket affordably.

What I think about at times like this is the impact of advertising.

The reason I like the three major conglomerates is their skillful advertising strategies.

High brands don't necessarily provide quality goods just because they're expensive.

I learn from their tactics of making people buy things with advertisements that tickle the self-esteem of "me, owning high-brand products."

In my case, I rarely reach for trends; rather, I'm the type who wants to visit individuals and small shops that honestly face technology and quality to find things that suit me.

As a result, I think I've met good people and things, and I want to believe my taste is being refined...

On the other hand, when thinking about doing business myself, I think advertising is important.

If people don't know about you, they won't pick up your products.

Advertising for that purpose.

Thinking that way, I can find meaning in my work too.

As a new working adult, I was able to join a company that would hire me.

While engineers can still make a living now, going to places like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Shibuya where foreign tourists and young people splurge is inspiring as a way of thinking about finding and sowing seeds for the next business.

Let's sow seeds again tomorrow.

# Finally

What should I do to earn money with my own power, not a salary?

First, let's find that and actually try it.
