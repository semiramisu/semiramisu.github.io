# Night Training

This morning I started reading [![Invest in Yourself](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81w7x-3EiPL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/gVYNsp2)

And my gaming laptop in the room is continuously generating videos with FramePack.

When I ran it Saturday night while sleeping, the fan noise was so loud I couldn't sleep.

I couldn't exercise during Sunday daytime because of the driving provisional license test.

So I finished dinner early and went to the gym from 7 PM.

Usually I'd stop thinking it would affect the next day, but my desire to move won.

It was just over an hour, so only back and triceps.

For back, the weight increased dramatically to 64kg, so I'm feeling good.

Tricep weight is also increasing - good!

The night gym had people but not much waiting, smooth.

# Morning Air

This morning's Tokyo air was clear.

Not air you want to breathe in, but air you can see far through.

I want to cherish morning time and dedicate it to reading.

Also, from this week I plan to go to the gym for 2 hours on weekday mornings.

Gradually increasing speed and training.

# Finally

I've been listening to this song since hearing about New Project:
