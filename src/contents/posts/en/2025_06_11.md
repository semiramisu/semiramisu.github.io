# Amazing Colleagues

The other day, I went to a gathering with colleagues from the same department, including business professionals.

It was a day where I was impressed by their enthusiasm and high conversational abilities.

Their hunger and motivation for engineers and AI are on a different level.

How can we use AI to achieve results?

I could feel their passionate desire to deepen business understanding by creating connections with engineers.

What left an even stronger impression was a business professional with a science background.

This person has programming knowledge and wants to become a bridge between business professionals and engineers.

They actively participated in conversations, carefully listening to and summarizing each engineer's area of expertise.

Seeing them made me acutely aware that I need to develop more ability to involve others around me.

However, my colleagues who can drink large amounts of alcohol on a Tuesday are amazing.

I've stopped drinking alcohol because it reduces productivity.

Today also ended in an instant.

I need to produce more results, or I'll be in trouble.
