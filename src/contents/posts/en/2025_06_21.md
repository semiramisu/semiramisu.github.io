# Successfully Passed

Today, I successfully graduated from driving school!

Yes, this phrasing means I don't have my license yet.

I still have to go to a facility that's only open on weekdays - a real pain for working adults - to take the written test.

For now, the driving school I've been leisurely attending since finishing journal writing in March is complete.

It wasn't a difficult three months with lots to learn - work on weekdays and cars on weekends.

Looking back, I was already familiar with my assignment location from a two-month internship, and my current driving school offers online lessons, making it easy to attend.

So it wasn't burdensome enough that I'm even thinking about getting a motorcycle license, which I had given up on.

It's nice to challenge new things!

However, since this cross-field challenge is now over, I need to think about another challenge.

Personally, I'm torn between seriously returning to piano which I did as a hobby, returning to guitar, or going for the violin I've always admired.

Well, in my current environment, guitar is the most convenient, so I think I'll do it along with other challenges like video posting.

Also, I'm thinking of increasing the flow of weekend training.

I've been listening to overseas podcasts lately and decided to incorporate new exercise habits, so this seems good.

# Finally

Let's continue new challenges and level up!

Just as I thought that, summer had arrived.

The season filled with the smell of burning grass.

This summer will be full of challenges too!
