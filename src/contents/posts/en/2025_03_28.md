# Making Things with Purpose Is Educational

Motivation!

I'm bored! I want to create a service often seen in restaurants!

I created a QR code menu system like those in restaurants with ChatGPT o3-mini-high
[Random Programs](https://github.com/semiramisu/QRcode_Menu)

# Technical Requirements

Language: PHP, MySQL
Environment?: MAMP
Assistant: Me
Main developer: ChatGPT-o3-mini-high

# After Creating It

Main implementation items:

1. Customer menu screen display
2. Menu inventory management screen
3. Menu deletion screen
4. Menu addition screen

Only 1. Customer menu screen is accessible to customers

Display of product photos, prices, and descriptions (ordering not possible)

2, 3, 4 can only be accessed by employees, and menu changes are reflected in the customer menu


A very simple program using PHP and MySQL

Actually, it would be better to create an employee login screen, but setting security aside for now, I investigated how much could be implemented in 2 hours

As a result, we reached a somewhat usable level.

The challenge is getting customers to read the QR code with their smartphones

# Production Flow

1. I explain the rough structure

2. First, have it output a simple program

3. Complete the framework of functions while humans make minor adjustments

4. Change to a rich appearance using CSS etc.

DONE

# Impressions

If the creator can solidify the requirements, production time can be drastically reduced

This was my second time touching PHP in my life, but it took shape to some extent.

Of course, if done by someone familiar with it, it could be made even faster and more accurately.

It's like LLM's job is to bring it to 80%, and humans work to bring it closer to 100%

It's become an easy era for people who make things or see problems to create solutions

# Complaint
I subscribed to ChatGPT for the first time in about a year.

When I subscribed through the iOS app, it was charged to my university account (graduating in March) instead of my personal iOS account.

Because I entered the app with iOS authentication. Perhaps it was paid as a continuation to the university account I subscribed to before...?

In preparation for the possibility of not being able to use the account after March, I wastefully used all 10 deep research queries

Good thing it wasn't a 30,000 yen monthly subscription

# Finally

I saw the possibility of people changing greatly depending on whether they know LLMs or not, and whether they have curiosity
