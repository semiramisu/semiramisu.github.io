# Thoughts

I read this book to the end while thinking it wasn't for me.

It takes about 40 minutes to finish, so even busy people can read it.

This time, while reading this book, I'll summarize my self-reflection on why I couldn't accept its content.

Honestly, this feels like it'll be the diary entry with the least substance.

I think the biggest reason I felt it wasn't for me was that I felt the author was really pushing their ideas on me.

The books I usually read are either based on scientific evidence or take a stance of "here's another way of thinking."

But what I felt from this book was less scientific evidence and more the author stating their passionate thoughts all at once.

Though it's also possible I'm just rejecting it because it hit my sore spots.

Additionally, thinking it's a typical self-help book might be another big reason.

Conversely, reading this book made me realize I don't need to read self-help books anymore, which was a gain.

If I think that 40 minutes of investment clarified my future reading direction, it was cheap.

(Actually, I'm reading it with Kindle Unlimited's 2-month 99 yen campaign, so there's no financial burden, which is why I can get away with this level of review)

So from now on, I want to shift to books that train the abilities I lack: verbalization, concrete-abstract thinking, and logical thinking.

# Finally

I think I was able to make use of Kindle Unlimited in the sense that I can easily read lots of books.

But I'm torn between paying nearly 1000 yen monthly for convenience versus borrowing for free but heavy from the library.
