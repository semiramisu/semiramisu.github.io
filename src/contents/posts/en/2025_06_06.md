# Becoming Someone in a Higher Position

The other day, I had the opportunity to have dinner with someone important from a slightly distant department.

This gathering was organized by a colleague who wanted to bring together other colleagues and higher-ups they wanted to get closer to.

I can only be grateful to people who can involve others like this.

During the conversation, I felt the difficulty of being in a higher position.

# Authority and Approachability

When you reach a higher position, a certain level of authority is expected of you.

As a result, new employees get the impression of a scary person in an important position.

This can be beneficial in many situations when leading a team.

The same words carry different weight depending on who says them.

(Though I wonder about that too)

On the other hand, people who originally enjoy socializing feel sad about this barrier when they rise in rank.

Indeed, from the perspective of junior staff, it's intimidating to invite a dignified, somewhat scary senior to a drinking party.

In the atmosphere of my current company, everyone happily joins for meals when invited from below.

However, it's hard to invite those who seem far above you.

Even when those higher-ups want to get along with new employees, in today's climate, reaching out from above risks being called power harassment.

As a result, if new employees take a passive stance, they can't get close to higher-ups.

Conversations with higher-ups raise your perspective and change your way of thinking.

I'm grateful to have joined a good company, and I want to make good use of my privilege as a new employee for the remaining 8 months.

# Finally

Before I knew it, I have dinner plans three times a week both this week and next.

I need to spread them out a bit more or my work performance will drop....
