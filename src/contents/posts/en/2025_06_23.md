# Reading Notes

With weekend driving school finished and weekday morning study time freed up, I'm going to dramatically increase my reading pace from here!!

This time I selected a philosophy-oriented book.

I originally like philosophy so I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if the content appeals to everyone.

# Memorable Parts

What particularly impressed me were Marcus Aurelius's words:

"What we hear are opinions, not facts."

"What we see is one way of thinking, not facts."

I felt the need to think carefully about these words.

In today's era, we can understand most things by asking AI.

I feel we've come to an age where we need to think about what we should think about ourselves.

Which parts of my work will become like telephone operator jobs?

I worry every day about where to focus.

Sometimes I wanted to rely on AI-related future predictions.

But thinking about it now, no one could predict the progress of LLMs to this point.

Recently, it was said that video generation would still take a long time.

However, video generation has already reached the practical stage.

In that case, designing myself based on someone's statements feels unpleasant, like entrusting my life choices to others.

Still, accessing the latest AI information is essential for work.

That's where the earlier words come in.

The words and reactions I'm encountering now are not facts, but one opinion.

Such opinions are important, but what's fundamentally important is what I want to do.

Thinking about my life's axis.

The axis here isn't work guidelines, but my way of living.

Being kind to someone, picking up trash - things that don't make money but make me feel bad if I don't do them.

In a sense, I think it's about how to maintain the dignity that makes me who I am.

Pride sounds somewhat cheap, and maybe I'm influenced by Shinya Aoki, but recently I've become conscious of the dignity I demand of myself.

From everyday behavior, does it match the dignity I seek?

Thinking this way reduces being swayed by immediate temptations, so I'll continue building while being conscious of my dignity.


## Stoic Self-Evaluation Criteria

What I thought I could use as someone becoming conscious of dignity are these Stoic self-evaluation criteria:

"Am I living in harmony with nature?

Am I using or polishing the four virtues of wisdom, temperance, justice, and courage?

Is my mind calm and composed?

Am I exercising reason?

What is the state of my character?"

I'll try asking myself daily whether I'm utilizing these four virtues.

I've been keeping a 5-year diary for 2 years now.

I want to add these new self-evaluation criteria to make it a self-reflection record.

Looking back, while working for about 2 months, days pass in an instant.

Today too, I noticed it was already 4 PM and the day flew by.

In that case, how much can I challenge and grow in this instant time?

Whether I can accumulate these will greatly change my growth curve.

If I don't quickly mix in my challenges and advance daily, the notice of engineer termination seems to be coming soon.

# Finally

This time I learned about Stoic philosophy.

The good thing about philosophy created in this era is that we can still use the stories of wise people who deeply faced themselves in times when death was close.

Ultimately, it remains 2000 years later because it's good teaching.

In this modern age that creates the illusion of fast flow, I feel those who can distance themselves from worldly matters and reflect on themselves will be happy.
