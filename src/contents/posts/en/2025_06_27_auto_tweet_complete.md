## Implementation of Automatic X Posting Feature

I've added a new feature to this blog. When a new article is posted, it will automatically be posted to X (formerly Twitter) as well.

### Implementation Details

- Using GitHub Actions
- Posting via X API v1.1
- With duplicate post prevention

Now, blog update announcements are automated!
