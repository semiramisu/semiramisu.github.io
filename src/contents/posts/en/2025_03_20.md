# Time to Face Myself

Recently, I've been maintaining peace of mind through activities that make me face myself.

Especially caring for leather products.

[![Leather shoes](https://store.sanyo-shokai.co.jp/cdn/shop/files/1148-Q740301309__C_1000x.jpg?v=1694309924)](https://store.sanyo-shokai.co.jp/products/Q7403013?from_brand=sanyoyamacho&variant=46802706071864&type=sanyoyamacho)

Sanyo Yamacho's flexible Goodyear shoes

The price is quite high at over 170,000 yen, but as expected from the brand's highest rank Kiwami series.

The upper is Marot calf, combined with flexible Goodyear for comfort.

The break-in period where leather shoes initially hurt your feet lasted only 2 days!

After one day of use, I dedicated a week to foot recovery, but after two days of wear in two weeks, the fit was perfect.

After that, no matter how much I wear them, there's no pain, and they're comfortable enough to run for trains.

Even with half rubber soles, I don't feel much stiffness, which might also be thanks to the flexible Goodyear.

Well, there's a possibility I think this way because I paid a lot of money, but it's something I'd like you to experience once.

So, caring for these leather shoes.

I never miss daily brushing after returning home, and apply cream lightly about once every two weeks.

I change the frequency depending on how hard I use them, but so far it's going well.

# Bags, Key Cases, Belts

For leather products other than shoes, I basically use items from [Somes Saddle](https://www.somes.co.jp/).

They're one of Japan's premier manufacturers, making saddles that jockeys entrust their lives to in horse racing, and also handling parts of carriages used by the Imperial family.

I've bought almost everything there - belts, key cases, handbags, pouches, backpacks.

Since I use these almost daily, I brush when I feel like it.

I apply cream about once every three months?

Personally, I think leather products last long and age beautifully, so I'm buying them while young.

In my case, thanks to muscle training, shirts I bought last year often don't fit, so I only buy things unrelated to body shape like shoes and bags.

I really want a leather jacket too, but my shoulder development has been good recently so that'll have to wait...


# Finally

Am I discovering a new side of myself - that I like activities that easily make things look clean, like polishing things I like or ironing shirts?

However, I've been thinking lately that I need to polish my inner self more.

When your aesthetic sense improves a bit, your view of others changes too, and you might gain new perspectives.
