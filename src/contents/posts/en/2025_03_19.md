# About Science Universities in the First Place

To be blunt, there's a clear difference between my seniors and juniors who have girlfriends and those who don't.

1. Do they have regular contact with women?

That's all there is to it.

The department I attended had about 10% women.

So there were no encounters.

Therefore, people with girlfriends found partners through clubs or group dates with high school classmates who went to other universities.

Me?

I spent six years at university without a girlfriend.

If I make excuses, there was COVID, implementation of online classes, and reduction of club activities.

Also, since my default from undergraduate days was "The sun has risen, let's go to university," I had no time to play. (Excuse)

# The Reality of People in Their 20s

I think dating apps have gained considerable social acceptance as a way to find partners.

Around me, three people have found partners through dating apps and are dating.

A friend who couldn't find a girlfriend even with dating apps made a slide presentation about dating apps and presented it after seminar.

Well, this was a joke, but it's so pervasive that such things are allowed.

Why is this?

Several hypotheses can be considered:

1. The psychological hurdle of meeting strangers has lowered due to SNS penetration
2. Meddlesome people have decreased
3. More people are moving to urban centers

Let's look at these specifically.

## 1. The Psychological Hurdle of Meeting Strangers Has Lowered Due to SNS Penetration

I think this is the biggest reason.

There are countless stories of people meeting through games or SNS, chatting first, exchanging LINE, and actually meeting.

Among my acquaintances, this is more prominent among women than men.

This is probably biased because there are many gaming-loving women around me.

I've even heard of people dating because they liked the same game streamer.

I can't understand this feeling, but resistance to meeting people from SNS in real life has decreased considerably.

I know friends who've had dangerous experiences as a result, but apparently they can't stop.

In the end, in modern times where hobbies and preferences have become fragmented, perhaps overlapping interests with people you meet in real life has decreased?

If you share impressions about favorite anime, idols, or games on SNS, communities of like-minded people form there.

While conversing within those communities, people are attracted to each other, hang out, become lovers, etc.

When I talk to such friends, some have met really good people while others always get bad matches (like people who commit DV or borrow money), so I think self-esteem is incredibly important.

People with lower self-esteem always seem to date strange people (N = 1 story).

It's a tough story for someone like me who isn't very interested in others & has only bad impressions of SNS.

## 2. Meddlesome People Have Decreased

When talking to slightly older people, there seemed to be meddlesome people in a good sense who would bring two people together.

I like listening to these types of people, so I actively talk to them.

However, meeting such people has become quite difficult.

The biggest issue is excessive wariness of "sexual harassment."

Honestly, how far is a joke and where "sexual harassment" begins differs depending on the relationship between the receiver and speaker.

I've spent time in baseball, a sports-oriented environment, so honestly I think I have tolerance for sexual and power harassment.

Essentially, I don't take such conversations heavily and sublimate them into laughter.

People who understand that I'm that kind of person give me harsh but useful advice in a way.

This honestly helps in work, life, and romance.

Because I can get free knowledge and experience from predecessors that others don't have.

If you skillfully utilize the power of meddlesome people, matchmaking-like meddling and knowledge accumulation becomes faster.

## 3. More People Are Moving to Urban Centers

Many people leave their hometowns for university and move to metropolitan areas.

At that time, they need to build new relationships.

If you fail at this like I did, you have no friends and consequently no girlfriend.

Unlike high school, universities don't share classrooms with the same members, so it's harder to develop camaraderie (I think).

This concentration in large cities might be part of the declining birthrate.

# Conclusion

So far, I've tried blaming others and the environment for not having a girlfriend.

Pretty good for self-affirmation, right!!

If you're going to university or choosing universities in the future, I recommend:

1. Choose a university with less gender imbalance
2. Join clubs

Well, in my case, I could devote myself to research because I didn't allocate resources to relationships, so it feels like wanting what I don't have.

It depends on what you value, so everyone do your best!
