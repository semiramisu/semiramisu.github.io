# Quick Skills

Today, work at my assigned department started.

After understanding the business - what stage it's at, how it monetizes - I received my first task.

First, I was given tasks to understand the data and get a feel for the work.

Let me summarize what I felt during this.

At work, I received explanations about necessary knowledge, data documentation, and the task.

Since I was assigned to the department where I worked as a pre-employment intern, I first read my past reflection notes.

I can clearly see where my past self got stuck, what I spent time on, and what I wasted.

From that reflection, I'm challenging myself to demonstrate quick skills this time.

# Approach

First, I create the format for my task planning document to show to senior colleagues.

By creating the format first, I can grasp which materials and data I need to use and capture the key points.

Previously, I would look at materials and data first.

As a result, I ended up reviewing materials two or three times afterward.

This time, by clarifying what I need to understand first, I think I saved some time.


Furthermore, by looking at data with purpose, questions arose, and I could ask senior colleagues at an early timing.

I can't yet judge whether questions arise from my lack of knowledge or insufficient business understanding.

It was good that I could find questions and ask them quickly.

Next is what analysis methods exist - since this is something I can research, I'll look it up first! My next action became clear.

# Summary

Find the goal first and run through quickly.

Since perfection from the start is impossible, first give it shape and show it!

It feels good to actually apply what I learned from books.
