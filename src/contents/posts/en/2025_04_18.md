# How to Direct Your Awareness

Sometimes you start noticing things you weren't aware of before.

Becoming a working professional and having complete self-responsibility has increased what I can do freely.

Among these, I've started wearing leather shoes to work often, as I mentioned before.

I don't want to be swayed by crowded trains, so I leave home by 6:30 AM.

This way, I can sit and have enough room to observe people around me.

And here's the thing.

I've started looking at people's shoes a lot.

Sneakers and leather shoes are common.

However, looking at the condition of leather shoes and sneakers, I feel like I can somehow understand the person.

People who maintain them beautifully, or those who probably prioritize walkability with synthetic leather shoes.

There are also people whose leather shoe condition suggests they're just wearing them as work etiquette.

I hadn't paid attention to such things before.

I only noticed after being able to buy my favorite leather products, especially leather shoes.

This surely exists in various fields.

Fashion, makeup, leather shoes, bags.

Just by directing your awareness, the scenery you see changes.

Surely, there are people evaluating me by looking at parts I can't see.

I want to live with attention to various aspects so I can see from many perspectives.

# Finally

This weekend is my driver's license (provisional license?) test.

Hmm, I hope it goes well.
