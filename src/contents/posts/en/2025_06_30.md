## Why I Picked Up This Book

I chose this book to improve the quality of my report writing.

As a Data Scientist, I've been thinking about how to write more clearly when summarizing analysis results and my task progress.

In the DS field, there are broadly two types of reports: reports for discussions with other DS professionals, and reports for non-DS professionals.

These two types of reports require different writing approaches.

The readers' knowledge differs, as do the purposes of the reports.

So I picked up this book hoping to find hints for writing accurate reports where interpretations align.

# Insights Gained

- Reading with structure in mind

What I can apply is reading with structure in mind.

Reading a book and understanding it.

I can do this without issues.

Of course, having written papers, I believe I can handle composition to some extent.

However, I felt the need to be conscious of structure when reading others' writing.

When I read my own writing the next day, I often notice oddities, or when I receive reviews, I often think "why didn't I notice that?"

I thought this might be because I don't have established patterns in my mind.

This book explains the importance of understanding text through structuring.

It also included exercises on dividing text into semantic paragraphs and creating diagrams to understand the main theme.

By thinking about structure when reading others' writing, I plan to develop the habit of being conscious of structure while reading.

Here's what I imagine the resulting thought process would be:

1. Read text with awareness of its structure

2. Accumulate patterns of easy-to-understand writing styles within myself

3. Having these patterns as a baseline for my own writing creates a sense of dissonance when I deviate from them

4. As a result, I can write more objectively than I do now

That's what I think.

While I've been reading through books until now, from now on I'll read with structure in mind.

# Finally

This book had its key points well organized, and I was able to finish it during my morning commute again.

Text with well-organized key points is indeed easy to read.
