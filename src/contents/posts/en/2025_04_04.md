# The Winny Incident Has Faded from Memory
Do you know about the Winny incident?

If you're an engineer, many of you probably do.

It's an incident where technology that could have become Japan's treasure was suppressed (or so I personally believe).

The other day, when talking with a non-engineer friend, they asked:

"Why doesn't Japan produce excellent technology?"

At that moment, I was shaken by the realization that there are already people who don't know about the Winny incident.

It was only recently that it was made into a movie starring everyone's favorite Higashide-san.

Yet there are already people who don't know about it.

# What Don't I Know?

Just because I don't know about something, aren't there other important information, incidents, or events that I'm unaware of?

Because of this, am I crushing someone's talent or hindering the world's progress?

Is ignorance a sin?

If I don't act to fill in what I don't know, won't I be strangling myself?

# Finally

Let's take action to learn what we don't know.
