# Where Sensibility Shows

Working part-time at a restaurant, I really realize there are all kinds of people.

People who stay past closing time even after being told the remaining time is 30 minutes when they enter.

People who leave trash scattered around.

People who are fine leaving food uneaten.

There's a certain percentage of people who casually do things I think are unthinkable.

What bothered me among these were children who come to restaurants and eat while constantly playing with smartphones or game devices.

Even when they come with parents, sometimes the parents don't scold this attitude.

Surely this behavior doesn't change at home or outside.

Doesn't that make them sad?

Indeed, being in the same place but with interests elsewhere.

Being in the same space but having different experiences.

Is there any meaning in coming out?

I prefer not to go out if possible.

If I can relax, home is fine.

But if I'm going out, I want some new experience.

Yet I don't understand the feelings of people who come out and constantly play games or use smartphones.

# Finally

Surely this cognitive gap won't be bridged.

When you're with similar people like engineers, you don't have these kinds of discoveries.

Customer service work has learning but is tough.

For expressers like novelists, it's a treasure trove of material, but it takes resolve to make it a lifelong job.

To all customer service workers: Thank you for your hard work today too.

Thank you.
