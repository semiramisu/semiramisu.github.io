# Cherish Your Company Cohort

It's been a week of specialized training divided by business, engineering, designers, and so on!

Yesterday, I went out drinking with members from different professions who were in the general training together!

We talked about our respective training content and assignments.

It was fun to have private conversations we couldn't have during training.

It was only 4 days of training, but they're good companions!

With all that, I went to bed after 1 AM.

But I still woke up at 6 AM as usual.

Once it becomes a habit, you can wake up automatically.

I'll work hard on weight training this weekend.

I'm savoring the happiness of having cohort members at work with whom I can have private conversations.

Also, do baseball team members share common relationship problems? lol
