# How to Use GitHub

GitHub is essential for team development.

During my pre-employment internship, I had no experience with team development using GitHub - commits? PRs? branches?

I was clearly a beginner.

That was embarrassing, so I learned basic operations through personal development and writing this blog.

Now it's been 3 weeks since I was assigned to work.

What I've realized as I've gotten used to team development:

*"You learn best by using it for work"*

Well, of course.

Furthermore, when developing in a team, you need to create lots of PRs.

During this:

- Can't we automate branch names and commit messages with AI?

- Can't we get notifications only for GitHub Actions failures?

- `git push origin HEAD` is so convenient for pushing!

And so on - because these are tasks I do in large quantities every day, I've become conscious of time-saving.

Steadily reducing small inefficiencies.

To level up in a year, let's focus on what needs focus!

# Finally

Cursor Claude-4 is too powerful - I'm impressed.

With this, we can replace everything from simple error fixes to a decent amount of work.

I wonder if it could pair program alongside my input in chat.
