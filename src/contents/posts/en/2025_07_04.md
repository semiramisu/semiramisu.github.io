# Monthly One-on-One

I had my monthly one-on-one with the head of the data science team.

During this meeting, there were many valuable insights about future careers and work perspectives that I'd like to document.

# The Gap Between What You Want and What the Team Needs

This is apparently a dilemma when assigning tasks.

For example, if someone clearly knows "I want to do job A," then it's great if they can do that job ⭕️

However, as a new graduate, you don't even know what kinds of work exist.

In that case, it seems best to handle the work currently needed by the team, accumulate successful experiences, and explore what you want to do along the way.

But from a leadership position, the work assigned at this time could change a newcomer's life trajectory.

Therefore, there's more to consider and it becomes difficult to decide what tasks to assign.

I'm grateful they think about it that deeply, while also feeling I need to produce results every day.

# Who Should Do This Work?

The second perspective I didn't have was about who should do the work.

For example, let's say there's a task that a veteran could complete in one week.

The task itself would be finished quickly, but there wouldn't be much learning involved.

On the other hand, if a newcomer does it:

It takes more time and requires support from others, but there's a lot of learning.

Therefore, you need to consider time and who would learn more from doing the work when assigning tasks.

I keenly felt the need for a perspective that nurtures the team, not just efficiency.

# Finally

The people who excel most at work are "those who combine tasks that must be done by the team with what they want to do, turning it into their work."

For that, I strongly felt the need to clarify current business challenges, each person's role, and what I want to do, then develop a strategy accordingly.
