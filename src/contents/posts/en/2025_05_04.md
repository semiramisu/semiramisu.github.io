After reading from Chapter 4 to the final chapter

# I Can't Stay the Way I Am

What I felt after reading from Chapter 4 to the final chapter is that things can't continue as they are now.

So let me summarize what I need to do.

# About Communication

First, be short and concise.

The other person doesn't know the background information.

That's why we typically try to be thorough and detailed.

But if you suddenly start talking about details, they won't understand (of course).



**Short and concise**

Once the other person understands and their next question emerges, then provide additional information.

It's exactly like English.

Start with the conclusion.

Add descriptive details and specific content afterward.

# About Coding


Keep notes about code in a way that can be shared with others.

Leave them as assets for your future self, for handovers, and for when you act as a mentor.

You might encounter the same error again, or your colleagues might encounter the same error.

The amount of assets that can quickly solve these issues leads to accelerated output.



Coding is meant to be read. Be conscious of writing in a way that engineers without context can understand the background information.

Use quick calls. It has a positive effect as it increases the progress of the entire team for those being asked.

I especially tend to research before asking questions.

Just clarify what you don't understand and ask quickly.

Absorb problems and unknowns all at once through questions, then learn on your own afterward - it's more efficient.

# About Discussions

Discussions are places where people without knowledge can absorb knowledge all at once.

You get immediate feedback, and it becomes an exercise in organizing your thoughts, so you should actually do it when you're a beginner.

It's not something for smart, knowledgeable people.

Be aware that it's a place to be polished through speaking.

It's definitely not a place for just criticism.

Furthermore, you develop the ability to "agree to disagree."

This is good because it frees you from comparison and being hurt, and eliminates the concept of failure.

You develop the ability to encompass "So that's how you think."

Conversational skills are necessary for mutually enhancing knowledge and improving together.

# Summary

How can I grow the fastest?

Keep that in mind when taking action.

Embarrassment doesn't matter.

What's needed is results, growth, and challenges - embarrassment is irrelevant.
