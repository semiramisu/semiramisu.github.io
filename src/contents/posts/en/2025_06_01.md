# Learning About My Decision-Making from Horse Racing

Let me clarify upfront that I'm actually in the black with my horse racing bets.

I start with 1000 yen each year as my initial stake, and if I make a profit, I carry it over to the following year.

With that self-defensive declaration out of the way...

The Japan Derby has come around, and this year's been exciting as always!

While I missed on my Derby bet, I successfully picked up Yutaka Take and Admire Terra's win bet at the Meguro Kinen, ending the day on a high note.

Looking back at my betting style, I noticed a clear difference between my successful and unsuccessful bets.

I think these decision-making patterns could be applicable to everyday life and work, so I'll summarize them here.

# Failed Decisions

My failed decisions tend to happen in these cases:

1. When emotions take the lead (betting based on favorite horses or wishful thinking)

2. When chasing big payoffs with high odds (10x or higher win bets)

Obviously, I lose when there's no data or rationale behind my choices.

Well, that's pretty obvious, right?

## When I Hit

1. Whether the odds are high or low, when I have my own reasoning

2. When the bet amount is manageable for me, under 10,000 yen

## Lose Your Cool, Lose Your Money

So far my balance is positive, but this isn't from hitting it big - it's from steadily picking up 2x and 3x returns.

These wins come when I can remove my emotions and wishful thinking from the equation.

## My Decision-Making Patterns

My decision-making patterns are as follows:

1. When I have my own rationale

2. When the amount is manageable for me, under 10,000 yen

3. When I stay calm

Success comes under these conditions, while getting swept up in emotions or wishful thinking leads to losses.

From this, I can see that in my case, success or failure hinges on how calmly I can make judgments.


# Summary

Through gambling on horse racing, I've come to understand my decision-making tendencies.

Perhaps having money on the line reveals people's true nature more clearly.

With that in mind, I plan to continue betting to sharpen my decision-making and patience.
