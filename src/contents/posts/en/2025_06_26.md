# What Consultants Learn in Their First Year

Based on yesterday's direction, I'm reading books focused on thinking methods I actually need to acquire.

I'll continue reading books about thinking methods and practice them daily.

I picked up this book because I wanted to improve my verbalization skills.

I personally think the analysis work and implementation I do as a DS has aspects similar to consulting.

So I read on, wanting to know thinking frameworks I could use.

# Useful Content

I'll start with what I thought I could use in my current tasks.

## Clarifying Work

1. Background and purpose of the work

2. Visualizing concrete results

3. Required quality

4. Priority and urgency

First, I need to clarify these four points before starting work.

It's important not just to think about these myself but to confirm with mentors and supervisors.

Work is executed to achieve team goals.

To make both myself, evaluators, and clients happy, we must first clarify and share the direction.

Self-centered work only leads to unhappiness.

Connected to this is:

"Thinking about how to think to get answers"

This is particularly useful in analysis work.

Even with the same data at hand, analysis methods differ depending on the purpose.

If you get this wrong, you waste computational resources and time, with only the deadline approaching.

I'll build a habit of checking early with superiors whether my thinking approach is correct.

## Creating Logic Trees

I felt that practicing creating logic trees is important for developing abilities I lack.

Benefits of creating logic trees:

1. Usable for life

2. Develops bird's-eye view ability

3. Develops ability to discard

4. Speeds up decision-making


Honestly, I feel the other benefits come from gaining the second one - bird's-eye view ability.

I'll practice creating logic trees daily based on current tasks or random world affairs.

The book says having someone review your logic trees is best, so I'll initially use LLMs for scoring.

Start easily and gradually!

## Cloud-Rain-Umbrella Proposal

This hit home as it exposed a problem directly relevant to my current task.

Facts, interpretation, action

Share after organizing these three points.

By approaching data with your own hypothesis, you can also find anti-patterns.

Hypotheses don't need to be correct, they're just hypotheses.

I understand them as minimum equipment for training my intuition from data and getting more information from data.

Speed in initially sharing the above hypotheses and results is also important.

While hitting the points for 60% completion, quickly output and get feedback.

Especially since my DS job isn't about producing beautiful reports, I understand there's value in early result sharing to speed up deciding next actions!

## Meeting Minutes

What I was missing regarding meeting minutes:

- What wasn't decided

- What was carried over to next time

Recording these.

If you don't properly share what wasn't decided, things hang in limbo and business can be delayed.

Let's also summarize what wasn't decided and what was carried over!

# Summary

It might be difficult to quickly reach the level that consulting teams polish daily.

But I think thinking ability is something that will remain useful even as LLMs evolve, so I want to develop it.
