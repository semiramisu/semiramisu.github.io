# Visual Understanding Enhancement Plan

When joining a new task, you first need to read documentation to understand the current system.

Honestly, reading documentation isn't the goal itself, but without proper understanding, rework often occurs, wasting extra time.

Especially in my case, even after reading documentation, I often don't grasp what's important.

So for programs that can be run locally or quickly error out, I run them and read the documentation where I get stuck.

In my current work, it's a task that's been running for a little while since launch.

Therefore, while documentation exists, it may not be updated to the latest state, or related documents might be stored in multiple locations.

This creates a need to reorganize the necessary information myself.

Initially, I aimed for understanding by copying and pasting, then modifying to expressions and writing styles I find clearer.

However, this became mainly a string of text with no visual hooks when looking back later.

Plus, it's true that text-only information makes your eyes glaze over.

I've been dealing with this by adding screenshots, but I realized creating flowcharts would be clearer.

Enter Mermaid.


# How to Use Mermaid

Mermaid itself is simple to use.

I throw the text I've compiled in my own words to an LLM.

Then I have it generate Mermaid code.

Using special characters can cause errors, so I fix those, or have related groups colored and enclosed.

As a result, readable flowcharts can be easily created from text.

In my case, visualization helps things stick in my mind dramatically better, so my Obsidian notes are packed with Mermaid diagrams.

The benefits are:

1. Information needs to be organized in your own words

2. It's visualized, making understanding faster

Additionally, when explaining my understanding to seniors to check if it's correct, it's clearer and eliminates misunderstandings.

So let's use Mermaid to understand quickly and focus on essential work!

# Finally

While I use tons of Mermaid diagrams, they're all in similar formats, so I'd like to explore other methods soon.
