# Cookie-Cutter People

Today, as always, I went to work out.

Twice: 3 hours from 6 AM to about 9 AM, and 2 hours from 4 PM to 6 PM.

Since I have time on weekends, I spend a lot of it reading and at the gym.

What I felt during this:

In the morning, many people are training while facing themselves.

On the other hand, in the evening, many people are training while playing with their phones during rest time? without even timing their rest periods.

I'm not criticizing others' training methods.

It's just interesting that even at the same gym, there are time periods when you can train comfortably and times when you can't.

Also, people who train while facing themselves in the morning tend to have more solid physiques.

Somehow, rather than worrying about how they appear to others, they focus on "How am I compared to yesterday's me?"

"Can I complete this rep?" That's their focus.

Meanwhile, evening people train while watching videos and SNS, perhaps concerned about others' eyes.


# You Can Only Change Yourself

Today marks the start of the Grand Sumo Tournament - a fun two weeks ahead.

But at that moment I thought: what's the point of supporting a wrestler from my hometown, being happy when they win and sad when they lose?

The easiest way to keep myself in good spirits is to face myself and feel moments of growth.

I wondered if outsourcing this to supporting others or being a fan is what some people do?

In the end, if you're not growing yourself, why can you support others so passionately?

Their success is wonderful, but it's something they achieved through their own effort - what did you do? That's what I end up thinking.

Well, I'm probably warped in this regard, so I won't push it on others.

However, I learned from people playing with phones at the gym that for my mental stability and sense of fulfillment, it's important to focus only on what I can change.

From now on, I'll go to the gym during times when there are more people who can change themselves - that is, people who train while facing themselves.

# Finally

When I'm training, people often ask "What are you aiming for?"

Are there more people who can't work hard without some goal...?

I don't really understand...
