# How to Set KPIs

The other day, there was an effectiveness verification workshop for ML/DS professionals.

What I felt at this workshop was: What is the purpose of the workshop?

Due to limited time, many things were crammed in, and I couldn't understand what the main objective was.

Based on this, I realized that I've been having conversations with my supervisor and manager without much thought.

My mindset was something like "The company policy is to have monthly meetings, so here we are."

But this training and one video changed my perspective.

## Reference Video

**[Must-Watch for Employees] If You Think of Your Boss as a Customer, Your Evaluation Will Automatically Rise! The Secret to Professional Consciousness [Clip]**

This video introduces specific advice on how to interact with supervisors. The perspective of "thinking of your boss as a customer" particularly became a catalyst for changing my attitude toward meetings.

When you think about it, or rather when you look at managers' schedules, they have many meetings with higher-level people.

These meetings can change the company's direction.

Since someone with such a high hourly rate is using their time for me, I need to make it worthwhile.

Adding to this element is the content from the video.

What phase is the business in now, and what are the challenges?

How much have I been able to commit to solving those challenges?

I need to understand what my supervisor is looking for.

Especially having professional consciousness.

Particularly as a new graduate, I'm not producing results worth my salary.

Yet since I'm receiving money, I'm a professional.

It's not about the manager guiding me, but what's important is how I think and act as a professional.

If I can apply those actions to solving team challenges, team evaluation goes up and the manager is happy.

So, the supervisor is also a customer.

It's impossible for them to grasp all the tasks I handle and everything I execute because they're too busy.

I need to properly communicate this and show how much I'm contributing to the team.

I decided to make this my KPI and approach meetings with this mindset.

# Finally

It was a session where I learned the importance of always having a purpose.

Also, looking at my records, I realized I need to use time boxing to better segment my time.
