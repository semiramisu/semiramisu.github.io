# Don't Throw Away Books, But Go Outside

Today was the provisional license test at driving school.

I passed successfully, so from now on it's on-road training.

Regarding the practical test, I hadn't gotten stuck once on the crank or S-curve until the day before, so in yesterday's lesson I deliberately rode up on them to learn recovery strategies.

As a result, thinking "it's okay to make mistakes" allowed me to handle the actual test calmly without panic.

Recovery from failure is important.

During this driving training, I remembered my past experiences.

Unable to focus on the test in front of me, remembering past failures.

Ah, I'm not living in the present, I thought, and focused on my breathing.

Noticing I was falling into a negative thought spiral and practicing bringing myself back was a good experience in itself.

# Learning New Things

On the way back, I borrowed books from the library.

I'm planning to mention the books I borrowed this time in book chats.

I want to go to the library and borrow books I don't usually read.

For example, women's entrepreneurship books, etc.

Keep books at hand, but also go outside!

New experiences broaden people's perspectives and resolve work blockages!

I'm dying from not understanding AWS, but let's keep going from tomorrow.

# Finally

New Project X - I've only been recording episodes without watching any until now.

Hatsune Miku - as someone from a generation whose adolescence was all about Hatsune Miku, it was enjoyable, and I was impressed by the engineers' energy, trial and error, and passion.

Even if it doesn't sell, even if it's thin, just keep going.

That's important.
