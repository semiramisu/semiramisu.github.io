# Final Day

Since I become a working adult tomorrow, my right to live freely during weekday daytime expires today.

Since I'll be cooking for myself from tomorrow, the day ended with meal prep, picking up sunglasses I bought for celebration, and muscle training.

For weekday meal prep, I'm using vegetables from [Tama Farm](https://tamafarm358.base.shop/).

I'm grateful for the fresh and abundant vegetables delivered.

My experience working at a restaurant came in handy for prep methods.

Indeed, if you live with purpose, you can apply it to real life.

# Declaration

I declare that I'll follow these in my life starting tomorrow!

1. Input knowledge daily from either books, D-Lab, or papers

2. Increase by one the daily life application scenes for inputted knowledge

3. First, produce results in 2 years

4. Participate in [Jurassic Cup](https://jurassiccup.com)! Do muscle training every morning!

# Finally

I need to make a plan for when I encounter the Tokyo Metropolitan earthquake while at work.
