# Reading Notes

[![The New Manager's First Year Textbook - 36 Rules for Foreign Company Managers to Always Achieve Results](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XqtJ0BzFL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/9R9dhJE)

While the content was aimed at managers, I felt that the first three chapters in particular should be read by new graduates from their first year.

The three points I found particularly helpful and will practice are:

- First decide and start moving

- Decide what to do if you fail and start running

- Escape the Concorde fallacy

# First Decide and Start Moving

Making decisions is necessary.

I tend to gather information to avoid failure before making decisions.

First, decide to do it, set a deadline, and start running.

As you go, more data will gather and you'll be able to make even better judgments.

So first, run.

As long as you have a hypothesis, you can verify it and make your next move.

# Decide What to Do If You Fail and Start Running

This is the same.

After all, it's not going to work perfectly the first time.

If you think about your next move, you can even enjoy failures as expected outcomes.

So just form a hypothesis and start running.

# Escape the Concorde Fallacy

This happens often in programming - the program you created doesn't work.

From there, you try to gradually improve it and make it better.

But throw that away for now.

What's necessary is achieving the goal, not completing the work you've progressed so far.

So think about what's needed to achieve the goal.

Think from zero about what's necessary to achieve it.

# Finally

I've been reading books about achieving results recently, and what they have in common is increasing initial velocity.

If you speed up the time until you start, the rest will work out well.

First, let's try.

So starting now, I'll also start a side business!
