# Encounters Are Precious

Today, I was invited by a senior from my part-time job to go cherry blossom viewing (in the rain).

This senior is someone about two decades older than me who treats me kindly - I can only be grateful.

They hosted? a cherry blossom viewing and asked me to come because they wanted to introduce me to others.

It was an honor and fun experience to meet people of different ages and different daily work.

# Who You Associate With

I'm not very good at socializing.

So when someone takes me out, my encounters expand dramatically.

While thinking I need to take the first step myself, I end up depending on people who pull me along.

I was invited this time, but I need to provide enjoyable times and value that makes people glad they were with me...


# Finally

I was surprised and convinced by the high ratio of science men around women who involve others.

Throwing away trash during the gathering, cleaning tables, clearing dishes.

This might not be my unique sense but the way science boys think.

Thank you, Sheena Ringo-sama!
