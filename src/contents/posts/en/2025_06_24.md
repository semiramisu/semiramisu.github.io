# Reading Record

This book is a quick read, so I think anyone can read it easily.

I'll keep my thoughts brief too.

While there might be few parts immediately applicable in Japanese companies, there were many areas I could change myself.

# Desk Organization and Task Management

Honestly, there was little new content for me in this book.

However, whether I'm actually implementing it is a different story.

What resonated was desk organization, task management for the next day, and meeting minutes creation.

Ultimately, it's about being able to start strong in the morning by summarizing what you'll do tomorrow.

For meeting minutes too, since what will be discussed is decided, it's simple - just create a template.

The problem is where to find that time in work.

But what I realized from practice is that even if it seems like extra work at first, it saves time overall.

It's faster to check if your axe is rusty before cutting wood.

# Wasteful Meetings and Speaking Up

What I thought I could use immediately was eliminating wasteful meetings and document creation.

As a newcomer who doesn't understand anything yet, I thought this is exactly when it's easier to say and should be implemented.

Also, being obsessive about securing your own time.

Fortunately, since it's a company with flexible working hours, time can be managed flexibly.

A month-long vacation is difficult, but there seem to be ways to handle daily life well.

# Finally

These types of books ultimately come down to "So, are you actually practicing it?"

Since how-to books themselves aren't stimulating, reading them occasionally to review your style seems like the right way to engage with them.
