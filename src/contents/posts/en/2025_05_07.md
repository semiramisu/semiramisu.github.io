# Reading Notes

[![Why Your Work Never Ends](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XkKr1UbLL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/0rSQxpa）

A book full of advice for properly executing work.

The three points I found particularly helpful were:

- Complete 80% of work in the first 20% of time given

- Don't finish work at the fastest possible speed

- With purpose, studying becomes easy

# Complete 80% of Work in the First 20% of Time Given

Let's say you're given 10 days for a task.

Say "Let me try it for 2 days to see how long it'll take."

In those first 2 days, complete 80% of the entire task.

If you can complete 80%, say "I can finish in the remaining 8 business days" and spend 80% of the time finishing the remaining 20% of work.

If you can't complete 80%, say "Please extend the deadline."

By achieving this rocket start, you can grasp the overall picture and have time for refinement in the remaining days.

Furthermore, since you can work with margin, mistakes decrease - nothing but benefits.

# Don't Finish Work at the Fastest Possible Speed

Using this rocket start to complete 80% of tasks in 20% of the time.

At this pace, it seems like you could finish the work in about 4 days.

But finish the work according to the original schedule.

The first 20% of time was achieved by investing overwhelming concentration.

You can't continue this forever.

Therefore, use the remaining 80% of time to improve accuracy.

Since you achieved a rocket start initially, there might be rough parts.

The key is to fix those.

Furthermore, in the remaining 80% of time, use morning hours as "slightly focused time."

Not as intense as the first 20% time, but work with heightened concentration.

Then work at a relaxed pace in the afternoon.

By creating flow within the entire work and within each day, you separate concentrated time from information gathering time.

# With Purpose, Studying Becomes Easy

Finally, purpose-driven studying.

For example, instead of "AI is trending so let's study AI,"

Where can AI be used in my work?

Connect studying to your work.

Do this studying during the relaxed afternoon time or in private time mentioned earlier.

This input enables the rocket start in the first 20% of time.

You need a period to store fuel.

If you connect that fuel to work and interests, you can increase refueling speed.

# Finally

This book particularly resonated with me.

Furthermore, the point about achieving a rocket start connects to what Minowa-san said in Kensuu-san's YouTube video I mentioned before.

"Don't always run at full speed."

Just reading or knowing isn't meaningful.

Having a perspective of putting it into practice also increases reading speed ⭕️
