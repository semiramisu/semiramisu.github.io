# Impressions Through Chapter 5

1. How to frame issues


2. Vertical, horizontal


3. Only 5% is visible


## How to Frame Issues

When faced with challenges like "CVR isn't improving," I felt the need for the ability to break them down into solvable problems.

This was also a point I keenly felt when actually experiencing DS work.

Even with massive amounts of data, whether you reach a solution depends on how many hypotheses you can consider.

For this, you need to shift your perspective like the eagle's eye, ant's eye, and fish's eye (I feel like I've heard this somewhere) and avoid fixating on one view.

Also, when breaking down into solvable problems, you need a certain level of knowledge about the industry of the challenge you're handling.

If it's a previously encountered problem, you can adopt similar approaches and reduce duplicate work.


## Vertical, Horizontal

You need to review midway which direction your thinking is going.

For reviewing, it might be good to write on sticky notes and paste them on paper with cross lines.

When explaining this to someone, it's easier if you clarify what thought process you based your thinking on.

Also, when things don't go well, you can implement measures in a different direction.

## 5%

The needs we understand from customer surveys and user purchase information are only 5%.

To begin with, most users don't respond to surveys.

Furthermore, users who left don't tell us what they disliked about the service.

We must recognize that the data we have is from a very small portion of a very small portion of customersâ€”something heavily biased.

On top of that, we need to consider what can be said from the data, what cannot be said, and the next measures.

# Finally

Developing the ability to infer the 95% hidden needs and what customers want, and creating services based on that.

I have wishful thinking that this might be the part AI can't yet replace.

I'll work while being careful to train this instinct!
