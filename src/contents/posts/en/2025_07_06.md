# How Much Money Do You Need in Life?

I've ended up reading another book about money.

Having started my working life and gotten used to handling money, plus with my iDeCo application approved, I picked this up hoping to put an end to my money worries here.

Also, it's written by Mr. Yamazaki, which was another factor.

What I felt after reading this book was the realization that once you calculate things regarding money, you don't need to think about it for quite a while.

Since the book presents Mr. Yamazaki's established arguments, there's no major change in the overall framework.

Long-term, low-cost investing as the foundation.

What was new to me were the formulas and information about pensions.

As for the formulas, I'll leave you to read the book itself.

As someone with a science background, I feel reassured when I see formulas.

They serve as guidelines that I can follow and be reasonably confident about.

Of course, overconfidence is dangerous, and I'll need to recalculate when my lifestyle changes, but having a core foundation is good.

Additionally, I found the sections about becoming elderly particularly helpful.

What's appropriate to do when you can no longer make investment decisions yourself?

The discussion about guardianship and the importance of setting things up so that your own decisions are limited to rebalancing.

Regarding this, I felt that programs that automatically rebalance to preset allocations will likely emerge in the future, but this strategy for old age was eye-opening.

# Time

Especially regarding time, combined with my recent conversation with our business manager, I had a realization.

I'm now 25 years old.

Due to taking a gap year and completing graduate school, I'm starting work up to 3 years later than my peers.

Moreover, in IT, there's no salary difference between undergraduate and graduate degrees.

Of course, within my generation, I'm in an industry that currently pays well, but I think this bubble will burst soon as AI develops.

Thinking about retiring at 60, that leaves 35 years.

Furthermore, in IT, there's no concept of lifetime employment, no retirement benefits, and no corporate pension.

I need to save from my salary myself.

Through the book's formulas, I strongly recognized that I have less working time compared to others.

And that I'm in an industry where future salaries are uncertain.

Three months after receiving my first paycheck, I've bought most of what I wanted, so from now on I plan to invest 2/3 of my monthly income.

That way, even if Japan becomes a developing country in the future, I think I can somehow survive.

# Summary

I've been worrying about money a lot lately.

But ultimately, I've come back to thinking that increasing my earning power and growing my seed money is the best approach.

I'll try not to unnecessarily raise my standard of living, and remember to enjoy life with modest means.

Also, since I probably won't need to recalculate (life phase changes) and can see a future where I continue enjoying the single life, I'll work hard to earn seed money for what I want to do!
