# Reunion with University Classmates

Today I reunited with my university classmates for the first time in 2 months.

Everyone is working hard at their respective jobs, which was inspiring.

What was particularly good was that we didn't talk about our university days at all.

This isn't because we disliked our university days.

Research was fun, and it was a fulfilling time.

It's also true that thanks to the training I received in the lab, I was able to get a job at a company I couldn't have imagined before being assigned there.

Therefore, our conversation was only about how we're going to rise in our companies from here.

How to get the president and executives to remember our faces.

Not just showing off, but how to communicate what we can do for the company.

Two hours passed in an instant with such conversations.

Department assignments, how to use money, work systems, and the direction of technologies to learn.

We were able to spend time thinking about what we can do now for the future.

I'm glad we're the type who can think ahead without being nostalgic about the past.

# Finally

Learning from the past is important.

But I believe there's no growth if you just get trapped in the past or only reminisce.

It was the best day to realize this.
