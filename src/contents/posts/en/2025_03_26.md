# The Future Is in Our Hands

I've been reconsidering what investments are time-efficient for me, looking at ROTI.

What are high and low investment multiplier activities for me?

## High Investment Multiplier Activities
・Muscle training
・Reading
・Information gathering
・Mental training
・English learning
・Entrepreneurship challenges

## Low Investment Multiplier Activities
・YouTube viewing
・Room cleaning and rearranging

# Next Steps
Fortunately, I hardly used social media, so limiting YouTube viewing should be manageable.

Since I haven't been spending time reading recently, I'll use the library, commute time, and this blog to increase reading volume and number of challenges.

Especially starting various investigations toward entrepreneurship.

Toward IT-based agriculture:

High-priced sellable ingredients, cultivation conditions, ingredients that sell overseas too.

There are many issues to investigate.

Is it better to go through JA, or would selling to specific stores have less margin?

I also need to test with simple planter cultivation to see if IT agriculture is even possible.

More fundamentally, I need to consider whether it's really agriculture.

Not much time remains.

I need to do inexpensive tests, sow many seeds, and select the optimal ones from among them.

# Finally

I want to work for myself and spit blood for myself
