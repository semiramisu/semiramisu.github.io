# How to Secure Lunch Time

How do you engineers secure your lunch time?

In my case, I make my own salad bento and bring it to the office.

When I go out for lunch, it's mainly carbohydrates, which makes me sleepy in the afternoon.

And above all, it's expensive!

That's why I bring my homemade salad bento.

However, I'm the type who forgets to eat when I'm focused.

As a result, even now at 8 PM as I write this blog, my lunch bento is still uneaten.

I don't feel hungry while working, and only realize I haven't eaten when I start getting ready to go home.

In this case, my dinner salad just gets bigger, so my total calorie intake stays the same...

I need to set a time to at least eat lunch around 4 PM.

In my case, I'm thinking of squeezing in lunch when I have downtime while running analysis tasks.

I wonder what others do...

# Finally

Despite saying all this, when there's a drinking party at night, I don't drink alcohol but eat the free food, so I'm cutting down on food expenses!

Free food is the most appreciated...
