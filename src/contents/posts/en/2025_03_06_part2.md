# Purpose

Here, I'll summarize the production and operation of this blog while I still remember.

## Services Used

Custom Domain [https://www.onamae.com]


Server [https://www.netlify.com]


Framework [https://astro.build]


Reference Template [https://github.com/WhitePaper233/yukina]


Helpful site for server and custom domain [https://ralacode.com/blog/post/add-onamae-domain-to-netlify/]

## Costs
The first year costs 0 yen.
From the second year, the following costs will apply (planned):

**Custom domain usage fee: 1,753 yen per year**

Currently using the server within the free tier.

For personal use, I think it will stay within the free tier, so the only cost for now is the domain fee.

Also, be careful not to forget to renew the domain. While you can acquire up to 9 years at once, I'm contracted for yearly renewal.

## Points Where I Got Stuck

1. I initially tried to run it on Github.io, but kept getting action errors.

Fortunately, since I planned to use netlify as the server, I haven't fixed the errors, but I'll fix them later since it's annoying to get error notifications every time I push.

Moreover, the benefits of using netlify aren't just about cost:

- You can investigate error causes using netlify's LLM

This is huge. For someone like me whose specialty is machine learning, I'm not necessarily knowledgeable about website construction. Furthermore, as someone who often programs for research with little practical experience, I can't always solve errors immediately even when I see error messages.

Of course, fixing errors is educational, but it's pointless if it distracts me and delays my knowledge output.

With netlify, the LLM tells you about errors so you just need to fix them, giving peace of mind even if errors occur when changing the blog layout.

2. Getting stuck with git push

Whether it was an SSH key issue or not, I couldn't push even though it was working halfway through.
I fixed it by addressing SSH-related issues.

# Finally

The experience of acquiring your own server and domain to create something that works is great.
As a machine learning engineer, I enjoyed working on parts I don't usually touch.
I've just climbed the first "I completely understand" peak, so I'm scared of the valley ahead...
