# Same Words and Relationships

The other day, our business manager took me out to dinner.

Every part of it was a learning experience, but what particularly resonated with me was this:

"Why are you shrinking back?"

It takes courage to propose business ideas to the business manager based on our hypotheses and analysis results.

When proposing to someone with more domain knowledge than yourself, you'll likely face rejection or have your shortcomings pointed out.

But what I was told was, "The manager is the manager because they have experience and knowledge. This gap can't be bridged. So you can't be intimidated by that."

That observation.

Indeed, I thought.

I should just honestly present what I felt from my analysis.

Whatever the result, that's just how it is.

Because the manager has more knowledge.

Expecting criticism as the norm and constantly challenging with that mindset leads to greater learning.

If you shrink back, your abilities won't be demonstrated and you won't produce results.

To contribute to the team through my work, I need to overcome that fear.

# Finally

For that reason, it's important to have opportunities to talk about things outside of work.

Just knowing what kind of person someone is reduces the tendency to shrink back.
