[![Masaru Sato's Special Lecture: War and Crisis - The Depths of the Ukraine War, Gaza War, and Taiwan Crisis](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uRD37jj8L._SY445_SX342_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E4%BD%90%E8%97%A4%E5%84%AA%E3%81%AE%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5%E8%AC%9B%E7%BE%A9-%E6%88%A6%E4%BA%89%E3%81%A8%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%8B-%E3%82%A6%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8A%E6%88%A6%E4%BA%89%E3%80%81%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B6%E6%88%A6%E4%BA%89%E3%80%81%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%8D%B1%E6%A9%9F%E3%81%AE%E6%B7%B1%E5%B1%A4-%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B3%E7%9B%B4%E3%81%97%E3%81%AE%E6%99%82%E9%96%93-%E4%BD%90%E8%97%A4%E5%84%AA-ebook/dp/B0DFLQF2DX?ref_=ast_author_dp&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SfAZFFtA3dxUvO8cUER-KeXzeiEMYb6EDG86G_iHkkYvD4_RQJos0v3FBt3o2sj_USK6CSBeohjRI3CRU63698E8hmSKtwO_-Ku2aNFhTq5gFVL2G7S_ddIiYVoZV3NmWwcpAm1eP17AUI9epWAvM1KizUa1LwN2xtlF5o6F66RpUjH7nmAyNHT1cKMQizDTUWeAmbgC38QU-OBU5JQBW4ztQ-vcx1wbSBtUNMkN3Is.2QsV266yJzYsxKWCFFVjHWyofbhujaINWFEsYrGmRmA&dib_tag=AUTHOR)


・Divine rights and human rights

・Understanding internal logic

・Open source intelligence

## Divine Rights and Human Rights
Divine rights and human rights.


Without understanding these two, it's difficult to properly grasp the movements of the world.

Especially for us who have been overwritten with Anglo-Saxon values after World War II, I felt this understanding is essential.

Especially religious perspectives. These are embedded in people's principles of life, culture, and daily life.

I felt that these differences become major clues for why judgments differ when encountering the same phenomena.

We cannot discuss current world affairs without deeply understanding the differences within Christianity and the teachings of Islam.

Though this is repeatedly discussed in this series, does GDP have meaning? Even if it does, from what position and for what results is it useful (or was it)?

Without knowing the values and background relationships behind decisions that are difficult to understand with numbers like GDP or our own values, we cannot act.

## Understanding Internal Logic

This largely overlaps with the latter part of the previous discussion.

Why are Russia, Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and America taking the actions they are in reality?

To understand this, understanding each party's internal logic is essential.

This understanding of internal logic was the part where I keenly felt my own deficiency.

International issues might sound grand when put that way.

However, when brought down to daily life, there are many parts where I'm aware of my lack of understanding of internal logic.

Especially in private communication.

I apologize for the prejudice, but when talking within engineering circles, I can understand to some extent what others are thinking.

On the other hand, when talking with non-engineers or women (is this because I attended a science university with almost no women? No, don't blame the environment), there are times when I don't understand what they're saying or trying to convey.


Simply not having shared topics with others is certainly one cause.

However, my thinking stopped there.

・**Why does this person talk about such things?**

・**Why are they hooked on this?**


I need to have interest and curiosity about others' internal logic without giving up thinking that they're different creatures from me.


It might be problematic that I need to think about such things just to have conversations, but it can't be helped.

This might be why I'm told I'm too stiff, too serious, and not fun.



## Open Source Intelligence

Finally, about open source intelligence.

In this series, this topic was brought up in the latter chapters every time.

The ability to utilize open source intelligence is increasing daily in modern society.

In recent times when armchair articles and opinions from misguided experts are being spread.

I feel the importance of accessing primary information and public institution information myself is increasing.

To understand the importance of accessing primary information within Japan, I recommend the [Democratic Party for the People's regular press conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/_8oBWXghcVM?si=uBzmlf8YQilDYI89) (every Friday from 2 PM).


Setting aside political likes and dislikes, after watching this conference, accessing secondary information the next morning in newspapers and online news shows how each company reports—you can see each company's colors through their word choices and title creation. At the same time, it teaches you the danger of fixing the secondary information media you view.


As a form of play, I participate in [Good Judgment](https://www.gjopen.com/), and I felt its importance there too.
Good Judgment is an interesting site that I'd like to cover later.

However, I strongly felt that without properly understanding internal logic and religious backgrounds, I cannot master open source intelligence for understanding world movements.

# Finally

I felt that all working adults should read the content of this special lecture.

We cannot work without the perspectives and cultural understanding presented here for understanding the world.

No job exists that isn't influenced by world affairs. Furthermore, when investing in NISA and such, we may need to change our portfolios depending on the world's direction.

This was a book where the subsequent life would greatly differ between those who have this knowledge and those who don't.

### ChatGPT's Proofreading
---
Text Evaluation (out of 100)
85 points

Reason

Understandability: The text is logically organized with clear intent. It develops along the theme, making it easy for readers to understand.
Readability: There are phrases close to spoken language and parts where thoughts are written as they flow, which some readers might find verbose.
Persuasiveness: The author's perspective is clear and includes personal experiences, making it persuasive. However, some metaphors and examples could be more refined.
Improvement Points
Overuse of "especially"

"Especially" appears frequently in short passages, making the rhythm somewhat monotonous.
Example: "Especially religious perspectives. These are embedded in people's principles of life, culture, and daily life."
→ Improvement: "Religious perspectives are deeply rooted in people's principles of life, culture, and daily life."
Too many "this" and "that"

Example: "Though this is repeatedly discussed in this series, does GDP have meaning?"
→ Improvement: "Though the book repeatedly discusses this, does GDP have meaning?"
Too many negative expressions like "cannot"

When negative expressions like "cannot discuss current world affairs" and "cannot master open source intelligence" continue, it creates a heavy impression.
Example: "We cannot discuss current world affairs."
→ Improvement: "Properly grasping world affairs requires deep understanding." (Using positive expressions creates a more forward-looking impression)
Organize conversational parts

"(Is this because I attended a science university with almost no women? No, don't blame the environment)"
→ Improvement: "This might be because I attended a science university with almost no women. However, I also think I shouldn't blame the environment." (Organizing more objectively makes it more refined)
The "as a form of play" part

"As a form of play, I participate in Good Judgment"
→ Here, "as an interesting endeavor" might be more appropriate than "play."
Overall Review
The text's intent is clear and logically organized, which is very good.
Tightening the expressions a bit more would make it more refined and readable.
Adjusting the balance between casual and formal expressions could potentially broaden the readership.
