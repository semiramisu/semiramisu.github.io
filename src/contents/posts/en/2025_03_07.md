[![Masaru Sato's Special Lecture: The Crisis of Democracy - The Encroaching Populism and Authoritarianism](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HklXdkfUL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/huovHG8)

First and foremost, I want to clarify that regarding books about world affairs and ideologies like democracy, I don't take their content at face value.

I plan to read the 10 recommended books listed at the end of this book, but I want to read books from people with various positions and ideologies evenly, and digest them within myself.

1. Differences between majoritarian and consensus types
2. Cycles of political systems
3. Inclination toward fascism
4. Perspectives on internet voting

## Differences Between Majoritarian and Consensus Types

・Majoritarian type: Proceeds according to the will of groups occupying more than half.


・Consensus type: Bringing it to a form that many people can accept

In my previous thinking, I had arbitrarily assumed that only the majoritarian type existed.

When I think about it, the consensus type feels more fitting to me.

The flow of trying to bring things together in a way that many people can accept seems to avoid friction compared to the violent decisions of majority rule.

## Cycles of Political Systems

There are several types of democracy, such as Anglo-Saxon democracy and American democracy.

Furthermore, governance methods show cycles like a snake.


Monarchy --> Tyranny


Tyranny --> Aristocracy


Aristocracy --> Oligarchy


Oligarchy --> Democracy


Democracy --> Monarchy

Opinions will differ on which method is superior.

What they have in common is that people who felt "oppressed" or "ignored" by the political system desire and realize the next political system.

There are many moments when I think we're gradually moving toward monarchy-like politics now...? (America and EU)

We need to watch closely how various political parties arise in Japan and what will happen in the future.

Furthermore, assuming this political system transition occurs, I felt the need to reconsider the extent of S&P 500 risk as an investment destination.


## Inclination Toward Fascism

Honestly, my thoughts on this haven't come together yet.

Is Japan's current politics heading toward mob rule?

What's happening in America?

I still lack knowledge in these areas.

## Perspectives on Internet Voting

As someone on the fringes of engineering, I was interested in Taiwan's internet utilization centered around Audrey Tang.

On the other hand, considering hacking risks and looking at current Diet members, I thought implementation would be difficult.

This book warned about the dangers of internet voting from a different perspective.


Maintaining secrecy - how can this be guaranteed? We need to consider whether such IT technology exists.


# Finally

Philosophy and democracy are themes I enjoy, and I could read this book smoothly.
While there were many authors I'd heard of, I also felt ignorant about Japanese researchers.

Since the people moving Japan are likely influenced by these ideas, I want to read more books by Japanese researchers.

### ChatGPT's Proofreading

There's a suspicion that it gives 75 points every time

---

Text Evaluation (out of 100)
75 points

Evaluation Points:

Readability: The flow of the story is generally easy to understand, and opinions are organized. However, some typos and redundant expressions hinder comprehension.
Logical consistency: There's a logical flow overall, but some parts (e.g., "Inclination Toward Fascism") have shallow considerations and lack specific arguments.
Balance of objectivity and subjectivity: There are many subjective impressions, and with few specific book contents or citations, it's difficult for readers to understand the book's content.
Improvement Points
Correct typos and omissions
→ Eliminating typos and making grammatically correct sentences will make reading smoother.

Reinforce explanations
→ For example, in the "Inclination Toward Fascism" chapter, supplementing which parts of the book suggest such tendencies would clarify the arguments.

Add objective information
→ Summarizing the book's claims and stating your opinions about them would increase persuasiveness.

Organize headings and lists
→ In the "Cycles of Political Systems" section, the bullet points like Monarchy → Tyranny appear somewhat messy. Better organization would improve readability.

Correction Example (for "Inclination Toward Fascism")
Before:

Honestly, my thoughts on this haven't come together yet.
Is Japan's current politics heading toward mob rule?
What's happening in America?
I still lack knowledge in these areas.

After:

The book presented specific examples of how fascism rises.
For example, in ○○ (specific description from the book), it describes how public dissatisfaction is exploited.
I wondered if such trends could be seen in current Japanese politics as well.
Meanwhile, America is in a situation like ○○, but can this be called a sign of fascism?
My thoughts haven't come together yet, but I want to deepen my understanding by reading more related books.

This kind of correction makes the consideration more specific and easier for readers to understand.
