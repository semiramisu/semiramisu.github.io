# You Decide Who You Want to Become

The other day, I had a meeting with our team manager.

During the meeting, I received valuable advice about future career development, which I'll summarize here as I think about my own growth declaration.


- You decide who you want to become

- Thinking about revenue contribution

- Six months to learn, six months to struggle


# You Decide Who You Want to Become

It may seem obvious, but you're the one who decides what you want to become.

1. Do you want to become a top-class engineer?

2. Do you want to achieve results by managing people like a manager?

These are the two that immediately come to mind.

In today's world where AI is replacing engineers more than expected, there might be other paths worth considering.

Rather than deciding immediately, I feel it's better to first aim to run at the cutting edge as an engineer, then decide later.

Somehow, I can see myself choosing by elimination because it seems impossible to reach the top as an engineer.

# Thinking About Revenue Contribution

I started working because I felt I couldn't contribute to society through research alone.

Therefore, I might have a strong desire to contribute through revenue.

Perhaps considering this point, I was told not to think too much about revenue contribution.

If you focus only on that, there will come a time when you feel "Was today wasted?"

Well, that's certainly true.

In the beginning, it's like toddling and difficult.

While thinking about becoming independent quickly, building a solid foundation is also important.

# Six Months to Learn, Six Months to Struggle

Right now, it's almost all firsts - SQL, AWS, and so on.

So rather than completing tasks, I feel like I'm spending time understanding the business.

That's why a day passes in an instant, and a week goes by in a flash.

Thanks to that, payday comes quickly too.

On the other hand, I was told I'd worry about the future after the first six months pass.

As a so-called rite of passage.

At that time, make good use of mentors and managers.

Using seniors' experiences well is also a privilege of being a company employee.

# Finally

Additionally, I was told to solidify the basics.

With LLMs emerging, there's talk overseas about junior engineers having no work to do.

While I can progress implementation by asking LLMs to some extent, I need to build fundamental skills even more.

I'll solve problems with my own abilities and use LLMs to evaluate the accuracy of my solutions.
