# Enjoyable Seniors

The other day, I had the opportunity to have dinner with my assigned HR person.

There, I was introduced to other HR staff, and we leisurely discussed everything from casual topics to career theories with fellow engineers from the same cohort.

What I felt during this was the importance of communication and the wonderful nature of people who face their work with full effort while also being passionate about their hobbies.

At drinking parties, when there are people meeting for the first time, we start with self-introductions.

After that, personal aspects come out and it becomes fun, and just when you think it's about time to wrap up, the tipsy members start sharing their true feelings - that's the complete set.

Especially when there are seniors or HR people present, there tend to be more frank discussions and enjoyable conversations that make you glad you attended.

This gathering was one of those.

Among them, people who face their hobbies with full passion appeared beautiful.

People who follow their favorite idols and go on weekend expeditions.

The way they happily talk about their hobbies gains everyone's empathy.

While thinking I need to do something too, I only do weight training and reading.

Well, as long as I enjoy it, that's fine, but I need to find some conversation topics.

After all that, I'm writing this blog on 4 hours of sleep with work starting early the next morning.

While drinking parties offer many enjoyable encounters and useful topics, it's tough that they run late into the night.

As a result, I've completely stopped drinking alcohol at gatherings.

Just the shortened sleep time is tough enough, adding alcohol would make it impossible.

Still, I want to praise myself for managing to get through a decent amount of work today.

It was a day that made me want to make friends both inside and outside the company.

# Finally

I'm glad to be at a company that says "Research shows that napping improves performance, so take a nap if you're sleepy."

I didn't actually nap, but it made me feel mentally at ease.
