# Careers That Intersected at a Point

First drinking party including juniors since high school graduation.

I want to praise my memory for recognizing who was who even after meeting after so long.

We talked about baseball team memories and everyone's careers.

Everyone has serious jobs, and I realized that career views and life views differ from person to person.

Especially since I was about the only engineer? Our ways of thinking are quite different.

Even though we had similar experiences at one time, our subsequent choices differ.

Interesting.

I've been thinking only about being an engineer since high school, but some friends saw other paths.

What created the differences from me, and how will those differences spread?


# What's Next?

I'm still early in my career and can choose to change jobs as a recent graduate.

Furthermore, choices await like whether to work in my hometown or bury my bones at my workplace.

To find options I haven't seen yet and choose well, it seems useful to occasionally meet friends like these whom I don't usually meet.

# Finally

Should I try contacting people I had brief connections with again...
