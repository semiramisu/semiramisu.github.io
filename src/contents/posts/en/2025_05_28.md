# Let's Actively Pick Up Work

In a good way, work isn't progressing smoothly!

Thankfully? I've run into a common problem that teams often encounter right from my first task.

Thanks to this, I've been blessed with the good fortune of being taught troubleshooting step-by-step from the very beginning.

Because of this, I've been doing a lot of differentiation between:

- Parts where basic knowledge is lacking

- Simply specification issues

And I'm starting to be able to make these distinctions!

It's particularly joyful that my verification methodologies for when I get stuck are increasing.

# Communication is Ultimately the Strongest

When people hear "engineer," many might think it means facing a computer with little human conversation.

In reality, while working with past programs and new data, I rely on team members a lot.

If I can't isolate problems myself, I end up asking everything from start to finish.

To be able to work independently next time:

- Documentation to check when stuck

- Verification methods to clarify program issues

- Collection of reusable programs

- Errors that team members have encountered in the past

I realized today that sharing these things with the team increases overall speed.

For that reason, I keenly felt the need to take on work that new employees can handle (because we're not yet productive) - like creating documentation or collecting error information that team members don't have time for - to improve my own abilities.

# Finally

I want to create a bot that collects and compiles common errors...
