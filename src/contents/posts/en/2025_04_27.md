# Visit Department Stores Sometimes

I went to Isetan, which I haven't been able to visit recently due to being busy.

Though even before, it was only about once every 2-3 months.

Not to buy anything, just to look.

But I recommend going to department stores like Isetan or Takashimaya because you somehow feel like you understand current Japan.

The number of foreign tourists, changes in product displays from last year, etc.

You can see who the department stores' main targets are now and what they want.

Of course, I'm not an expert in that area, so this is just my personal sense.

However, meeting people you don't usually meet and looking through the filter of thinking from their perspective makes the same cityscape look different.

Well, the formal beauty is completed by looking at things I want and saying "Expensive!"

# Summary

Material desire is the driving force that moves people.

I feel it's necessary to understand what people want now, both to read the times and to not be swept away.

So let's occasionally go to department stores beyond our means!
