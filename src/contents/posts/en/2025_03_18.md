# Whether It's Easy to Understand or Not

The other day, my family and I filed e-Tax.

With an iPhone and My Number card, it was completed in about an hour.

I felt it was convenient to complete at home and receive the refund (high-cost medical care) in three weeks.

On the other hand, there were points that felt difficult to use.

・Linking salary
・Confusing procedures

First, you need to reflect the head of household's salary.

It would be easy if this were already reflected in My Number, but you need to set it up separately once.

Of course, I think the idea is that information is less likely to leak because it's not directly linked to My Number (key image) (probably).

But honestly, I also wished salary and medical expenses would be linked automatically and refunded without doing anything.

For tax payment, they automatically deduct from salary, but for refunds, we have to apply ourselves—I felt the intention that they don't really want to refund.

I'd be happy if the procedures were simpler too.

This time, someone fairly strong in IT used e-Tax for the first time.

Even so, I can't say I understood the procedure at first glance.

Of course, if they say our heads aren't good enough, that's that.

However, with an aging society progressing and everyone being overwhelmed by daily work, isn't building an easy-to-understand system also the country's role?

It was educational in that if this were a private service, it would be eliminated by easier-to-use services.

Even though there's a refund, how many times I almost gave up...


# Finally

Keep systems simple.

Make subscription cancellation and refund systems complex.

This way you can make profits! (Bad example)
