# Introducing a Split Keyboard

I recently bought a split keyboard using my company's benefits program.

[keychron Q11](https://keychron.co.jp/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard-us-ansi-layout?variant=42588337209515)

It's a US layout split keyboard.

Previously, I was using a personally purchased HHKB.

The HHKB is also US layout, and I had absolutely no complaints about it.

However, I wanted to stop my shoulders from rolling inward during long typing sessions, so I decided to try a split keyboard.

# Advantages of Split Keyboards

- Reduced shoulder strain

- Can place a notebook in the center of the desk

These two points are the major advantages.

Especially for someone who works out like me, having shoulders roll inward isn't good.

I'm happy this pain is gone.

I'm also pleased that I now have space in the middle of the table.

I understand the whole picture and manage tasks by drawing diagrams in notebooks.

Being able to place the notebook and pen in the center means I can access them just by lowering my eyes from the screen, which is comfortable.

# Disadvantages of Split Keyboards

- Typing errors are noticeable

- Takes time to customize the key layout to your preference


I think the typing issue isn't hard to imagine.

It probably wouldn't be a problem with proper typing skills, but I have self-taught habits mixed in.

Particularly with my right hand, overusing my index and middle fingers is clearly causing problems.

Additionally, being used to HHKB, new keys like arrow keys that weren't there before take time to get used to.

I ended up customizing the key layout to match HHKB's layout.

To add, I also purchased the official palm rest for split keyboards, but the hard palm rest hurts the base of my palms, which is another drawback.

I'm thinking of wrapping it with cloth.

# Finally

I purchased this product as a split keyboard that could be bought with company expenses.

I was actually considering a keyball, but I think I'll purchase that myself for home use.
