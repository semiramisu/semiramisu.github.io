# Direction of Engineer Networking

I'm thinking about how to exchange technology and communicate among engineers.

Well, this blog is part of that...

In recent years, LT (Lightning Talk) sessions within companies or business units are widely held.

These mainly focus on technology and personnel exchanges within departments.

Furthermore, there are LT sessions held online, and multiple companies hold LT sessions by field such as iOS or backend.

Participating in these becomes a place for output and helps sell your face - killing two birds with one stone.

Especially people who like being in front of others often present.

Even for people like me who can talk in small gatherings but become wallflowers in large groups, becoming a presenter allows you to present and answer questions - it's a good place.

Well, the issue is that they're mainly held in the evening.

However, I've been reconsidering lately whether participating in these events is the right thing to do.

# Is It Good to Flock Only with Engineers?

Especially in my case, I don't think I can make a living as an engineer.

IT is just a means.

Since it's a means, it's not the goal.

If I can clear challenges without writing code, I'll gladly not write it - that's the difference between me and other engineers.

If I want to develop this difference, I should go to business networking events rather than engineer meetups.

Furthermore, considering my communication style, it's often better to be connected through super connectors.

Thinking this way, I've been feeling lately that it might be better to learn individually or with AI without succumbing to peer pressure.

Especially recently, many useful videos are uploaded to YouTube.

Recently I often watch [TECHWORLD111 (YouTube channel)](https://www.youtube.com/@TECHWORLD111).

Then I get other perspectives like: technical skills are important, but how do you act to realize who you want to become?

Studying English might lead to income increase alone, and so on.

Deep connections might be important, but I've been thinking lately that weak connections might also be important.

# Finally

I've been thinking lately about socializing in ways that suit my characteristics.

For now, I've realized marriage is impossible, so I've started building a portfolio just for myself.

I've decided to go all-in on stocks while young, and started evaluating individual stocks!
