# New Graduates' Upward Pressure

Another social gathering!

As I've gotten more used to work, I've been able to hear even better stories.

This time, about new employees' upward pressure.

In a good way, new employees haven't yet learned to read the team's atmosphere.

Therefore, they don't think things like "Since Mr. A is here, let's play it safe in this meeting."

They'll overlook somewhat rude attitudes.

There are limits, and it's premised on properly achieving results.

As a result, you can get much closer to seniors and let them know your character.

This chance only exists during your first year as a new employee.

Gradually, you'll get used to the company and find just the right compromise.

As a result, you lose that upward pressure.

Now, when there are still many things I don't understand well, is the chance!

I'll keep involving more people!

Speaking of upward pressure, there's AI utilization.

I've come to rely on AI for most things, and while I think some engineers will dislike me for it, I'm working hard.

While AI utilization is being promoted company-wide, new employees can use it extensively to achieve the same results as seniors.

Well, actually when programming with AI, I deeply feel the importance of my fundamental skills and end up writing programs during self-study time anyway, so I still need time to train myself for efficient AI utilization for the time being.

How can I achieve the same results as current seniors while using AI?

While focusing on that, I'll become someone who delivers results quickly.

# Finally

The iDeCo account I applied for in April finally opened.

Since I applied in April, I can invest collectively from April's portion, so I had fewer lost opportunities!

Both studying and investing are about steady progress.
