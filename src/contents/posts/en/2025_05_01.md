# Learn From Others' Behavior to Improve Your Own

Recently, I've been feeling small discomforts when observing people around me.

I don't think this is a good thing, as it's likely that I'm just in an irritable mood.

What's been particularly bothering me lately are chewing sounds and eating habits.

I feel like the chewing sounds of people who are thinking about something else during meals and not focusing on their food echo throughout the surroundings.

Perhaps because many people eat while looking at their smartphones these days, I seem to notice this more often.

But what about myself?

Once I start worrying about it, I find myself eating nervously.

Due to my chronic sinusitis, I sometimes breathe through my mouth without realizing it.

When that happens, I often worry that I'm not properly closing my mouth.

Learn from others' behavior to improve your own.

When eating, take small bites!

Make sure to chew properly before opening your mouth!

Let's steadily build up these basic habits.

# Summary

I've been maintaining my gym routine for a month now - 2-hour morning sessions twice on weekdays, plus weekend sessions, for a total of 4 times a week!

I'm happy that I'm able to lift heavier weights.

Consistency is power.
