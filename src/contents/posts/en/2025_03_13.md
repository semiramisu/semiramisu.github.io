# Impressions

Too much of the content hit home for me.

A book by Shinya Aoki, originally my favorite fighter.

It's been quite a while since publication, and if asked "Are you reading it now?" that's all there is to it.

However, with research wrapped up, starting work in April, not knowing what will happen in the IT industry, I wanted to hear Shinya Aoki's words.

Recently he's even started YouTube, which I'm grateful for.


# In This World Where You're Crushed by Others' Common Sense

Particularly memorable words (including paraphrasing)

1. Be able to explain the reason for owning everything you have.
Take responsibility for your choices

2. The world isn't sweet enough for you to succeed with scattered desires

3. To make a loss meaningful, you can only cherish the process. For that, steadily handle tough training

4. What's important isn't eliminating nervousness. It's dealing well with emotions that could drive you insane.

5. Always think about what your price is, and be conscious of being someone everyone wants.

6. The important thing is to continue working with conviction without being swayed by others' evaluations.

7. Your current hell can be turned into an asset depending on your future efforts


8. Be conscious of taking something from everyone you interact with. This is also utilized in contrarian thinking.

9. In this one life, there's no time to be confused by societal "happiness."

10. Since no bubble lasts forever, what's important is how to not lose yourself and steadily increase your value.


# Too Many People Use Words Lightly Without Taking Responsibility

I've lived my life without crossing paths.

In that aspect, I overlap with Aoki.

However, after finishing job hunting and facing the timing of entering society, I became scared.

Choosing companies by "annual income," choosing companies by "recognition."

I thought I wasn't doing these two things.

Honestly, I think the IT industry is a bubble.

Standing on a bubble created by AI, that bubble will surely break and disappear because of AI.

If I don't increase my value as an engineer, my own value, I'll quickly degrade into a replaceable part.

A phrase I often use is "work without human dignity."

This isn't meant to disparage anyone.

"Can I be proud of my actions and goals to my past, present, and future self?"

I use it as the antonym to admonish myself.

Thanks to the AI wave, the IT wave, I'm receiving a certain amount of money for my generation's starting salary.

But that's not because my abilities were evaluated.

I just happened to ride a flow created by predecessors.

I must not forget that fact.

Like the bubble 30 years ago, it will definitely burst.

I'm on a beautiful, fragile bubble.

Polishing myself, suffering, struggling, lamenting, crying, hurting.

Even if called Showa-era values, I'll do something like power harassment to myself, heat myself, strike, and shape.

If I don't carve out my future with the knife I've made, I'll become just another fraud who only complains about the status quo.


"Is that your value? Is that your victory?"

Life passes in an instant.

# Finally

Once again, I'm glad I quit social media.

It's too strong a medicine for me.

I become afraid of seeing differences with others.

In this maddening daily life, still, one step at a time.

Just you wait. I'll definitely see through my own way with my methods.
