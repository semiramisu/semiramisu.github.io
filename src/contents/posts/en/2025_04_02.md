# Use Your Morning Time

I don't want to ride crowded trains.

I want to do meditation, weight training, and self-study in the morning.

So I'm doing off-peak commuting (day 2).

If you don't make it a habit from the very beginning, it's difficult to turn it into a habit later.

So I went to the gym after 7 AM.

At the Anytime Fitness in Shibuya, there were many people with the same idea.

I respect those who were doing partner workouts.

However, it was a bit hard to use because it's small and crowded...

Maybe I should switch to Gold's Gym...

# Self-Reflection

After that, I did Salad Fight and Paleo-san's Deep Question Work.

Since working means less private time, let's use the energetic and quiet morning hours for ourselves!

However, Deep Questions really drain your energy because you're facing yourself, but they provide a lot of daily guidance.

# Finally

Let's secure time for ourselves and then sprint full speed at work!

For now, I'll leave a bit more to chance!

Take more risks!
