# Claude Code GitHub Action

## Overview

What was previously only possible using APIs can now be done with GitHub Actions.

This is a big deal as it means simple feature additions can now be completed entirely on the web.

I'm leaving some notes here for my own reference about the parts I got stuck on.

Though it was really just a simple oversight on my part.

I referenced this article as it was the fastest one I found covering this topic.

# Where I Got Stuck

I added Claude Code GitHub to my blog this time.

During this process, the repository I wanted to add wasn't being recognized properly.

The solution was to push all local changes first, then git clone the repository again - that worked.

This issue might have occurred because I had previously modified the folder structure.

Even when following the image instructions and entering my repository URL, I couldn't press Enter, which was frustrating.

If you encounter the same issue, try deleting your local folder and doing a fresh git clone.

## Additional Note

Additionally, I deleted Claude from GitHub before proceeding as I was somewhat concerned.

I did this because in the Issue discussing this feature, someone suggested trying to remove Claude from GitHub if things weren't working.

I'm not sure how this affected the outcome, but it might be worth trying.

# Conclusion

With this feature, personal development that can be completed with Claude Code can now be done entirely on a smartphone.

As someone who hasn't done much development before, this significantly lowers the barrier to entry, which I'm grateful for.

Also, since all change history is preserved in Issues and PRs, it's easier to track what was done.

Being able to easily revert code changes makes it possible to experiment with various feature improvements.

Additionally, I think the importance of tests run on PRs, which I hadn't paid much attention to in personal projects, has increased.

If these are properly set up, there should be fewer problematic commits and development efficiency should improve.

# Final Thoughts

Want to create a service but lack the knowledge...

While there are still considerations like security, it's now easy to create prototypes.

It seems like we'll see more personal development services, and I want to ride this wave properly!
