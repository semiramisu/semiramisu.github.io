# First Paycheck!

Today, I received my first paycheck.

I thought I wouldn't get anything in April, but it was a pleasant surprise.

Of course, it's not the full amount but half, but I'm happy nonetheless.

However, honestly, it's more than my previous part-time wages and I'm troubled about how to handle it.

Furthermore, after working for half a month, I've only spent money on cooking for myself, so it just keeps accumulating.

# What Should I Use It For?

However, it's true that if I buy what I want, it'll disappear in an instant.

After all, it's best to invest it first.

So in the end, half of my salary went to NISA.

Since the S&P 500 was still in a declining phase, I think I made a good purchase.

Well, there's the possibility of the yen strengthening or further declines in the future, so I can't say for sure...

Since it's long-term investment anyway, I'll try not to worry about it.

The rest is how much to allocate to bonds.

I couldn't afford bonds with this month's cash flow, but I'm considering bond indexes.

Well, in the end, currency risk doesn't leave my mind...

# Summary

When I step outside, there are things I want (leather jackets, shoes, etc.), but if I invest first and have no money, I can't buy them - that's the logic.

So I tried investing using time, the greatest asset of young people.

However, a working professional's day goes by fast.
