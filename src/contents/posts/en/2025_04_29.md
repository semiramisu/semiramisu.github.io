# What Do I Spend Money and Holidays On Again?

My first paycheck came in, and I threw half into NISA.

For the rest, after using necessary expenses, I'm keeping the remainder as seed money for when stocks fall again.

I've also applied for iDeCo, and from next month I'll be contributing there too.

Since IT companies don't have company pensions or retirement benefits, I shouldn't be affected by the recent iDeCo deterioration (probably).

Then the challenge becomes what to do with the money left in hand.

Since I have credit card payments, I need to keep a certain amount in my account.

But what to use the rest for?

Travel, hobbies, maintaining friendships, perhaps?

My hobbies are reading, guitar, weight training - things that don't cost much money.

As a result, for hobbies I only spend on monthly gym fees and food expenses.

Looking at engineers around me, they spend on games, idol performances, merchandise, etc.

But in my case, while I understand meals with friends, I can't understand throwing money at celebrities, so I don't have those expenses.

Maybe it's because my interests are directed at myself.

I should use my limited time and money on things that give me experiences and knowledge, so why use it on others...

Well, saying things like this makes you stand out, so I need to be careful.

So I have no use for money.

Gold prices are rising, and if the yen strengthens due to President Trump's influence, it'll be time to buy more stocks, so I have to keep it on hand.

I wandered around shops today too, but found nothing I particularly wanted to buy.

Hmm, having no interest in surroundings is questionable, so maybe I should have some external interests.

# Summary

As a result of getting money called my first paycheck, I realized the reality that there's nothing I want.

It's too late for real estate flipping, so let's think of some new entertainment.
