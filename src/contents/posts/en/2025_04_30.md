[![What I Learned About Money and Life's Essence from Having Cancer](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uiNvqSUTL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/fR4z3h7)

As a new working professional, my self-responsibility and freedom have increased.

Setting aside for now that these are two sides of the same coin.

Within this, I've been thinking more about how to use money.

In my mind, aside from minimum living expenses, I'm putting about 80% of my income into asset management (I've set up regular investments with that assumption).

Is this the right way to use it?

Looking around, many people use money on relationships or drinking.

Is my way of using money really okay?

I read this book to get hints for that.

I'm grateful I could read it easily with Kindle Unlimited's 2-month free trial.

# Learning

In this book, the author who got cancer reconsiders money, things, and relationships with family and friends.

This may be rude to say, but I felt the waste was stripped away because it was thinking with a deadline approaching.

In our information-overloaded modern times, it was full of truly valuable descriptions.

What particularly impressed me were these three points:

- Don't worry about sunk costs. Don't overlook opportunity costs.

- Money is a means for living.

- Turn anger into trust, empathy, and pride.


Furthermore, I was grateful that the author explained money by referencing "DIE WITH ZERO" and mixing in their own opinions.

It's a bible-like book about how I use money, and it's one I still reread regularly.

The content was helpful for everything - money, information, anger, value judgments.

This time, there are three points I'll apply from this book:

- Use money for self-growth while young

- Don't spend money on positional goods

- Don't worry about investing, set automatic deposits and leave it alone

# Summary

There are still many points to learn and practice from this book.

Thinking about my remaining life, I must make each day fulfilling.
