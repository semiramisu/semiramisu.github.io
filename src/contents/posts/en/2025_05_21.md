# Time Recording

First, record what you're doing and how you feel every 30 minutes.

Find what activities bring you joy and which ones you don't enjoy.

Then, you can delegate to others or eliminate tasks that don't need to be done at all.

You can act while reconsidering what actions make you happy.

I learned this from another book before reading this one, and I've been recording every 30 minutes in Obsidian.

With records, the end-of-day reflection becomes richer.

What went well, what were the sticking points, what improvements could eliminate this waste?

On the other hand, there are tasks at work that must be done but aren't enjoyable.

The next chapter is helpful for that.

# Higher-Level Goals

What's my work motivation?

I went to an IT university and became an engineer because I thought it would provide job security - that I could make money.

I wasn't particularly good at math and preferred history and literature, but I chose science thinking I wouldn't study math unless it was for university entrance exams.

Though that caused me to fail and retake the exam for a year.

Therefore, my frank answer becomes "to make money."

But with that, boring tasks remain boring.

That's where higher-level goals become necessary.

You can use job crafting to dig deeper, or continuously ask "why?"

I recommend asking ChatGPT to keep asking "why?"

You can dig quite deep into your inner self.

In my case, I have a vague thought of "making people happy through IT."

In more dangerous terms, "a human life for everyone."

Rather than doing work where anyone could achieve the same results, I want people to engage in activities that only they should do.

I'm experimenting with whether AI and machine learning can help with this.

I think of it as being educated while receiving money from the company to polish the knowledge, experience, and skills for this purpose.


# You Can Be Happy by Focusing

This is also a commonly heard story.

Having an active weekend leads to higher Monday morning motivation than lounging at home.

Ultimately, if you have activities you can focus on, that leads to happiness.

Activities that allow self-determination and lead to self-growth naturally enable focus and build abilities - killing two birds with one stone.

Like working out, music, or art.

I want to increase my music time a bit more.

After piano and guitar, I want to try the violin I've long desired, but first let me start with preparations to monetize this hobby.


# Create Specialness with Rituals

What was initially special loses its impact through repetition.

Common, right?

The default is eventually not talking to people anymore.

Several activities to unearth small joys in life:

1. Be aware of endings

2. Make it a ritual

3. Take a break


## Be Aware of Endings

Everything comes to an end.

If life lasts until 80, how many days remain?

What percentage has already passed?

I display this in my diary to remind myself daily that this won't continue forever, which is apparently good.

Also, count the number of times you can spend with your pet, parents, or children, or the number of meals.

You'll find it's fewer than you think.

Then you can cherish each time, spend it with focus, and increase happiness.


## Make It a Ritual

There's also a method to counter habituation by creating specialness.

Make it a clear ritual.

If you clarify the procedure and make it feel sacred, you can distance yourself from habituation.

I haven't decided how to incorporate this into my life, but I want to try something.

Maybe morning coffee time?

## Take a Break

This is simple.

Just stop for a while.

If it's truly important, you can restart later, but most things are done out of obligation.

Just try quitting.

# Summary

Find your happiness tasks from daily records.

While extending that time and improving results, also connect obligatory tasks to your higher-level goals.

The importance of recording and utilizing it.

And again, focus.

Quit SNS, meditate, and distance yourself from the secular world!
