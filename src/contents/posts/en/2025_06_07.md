# I Don't Learn Unless Forced To

Currently, I'm mainly working as a Data Scientist.

Since analysis is my main focus, I've been frequently writing SQL in addition to Python.

While I did touch Python somewhat in my research, my programming ability isn't particularly high.

Probably among my cohort, I'd be counted from the bottom.

Even recognizing this, I hadn't been writing Python or SQL on my own.

Even when writing analysis programs for hobby purposes, I haven't been studying properly.

The reason is simple: lack of motivation.

- Learning when necessary is more effective

- I understand better what to learn when the need arises

These were my main reasons.

# If You're Frustrated, Do It Properly

I'd been managing somehow like this, but the other day I finally encountered a situation where I needed to learn SQL properly.

When I executed SQL I created, it should have been working correctly, but the results weren't reflected in the management dashboard used for business.

To conclude, it was because I had misconfigured the dashboard settings, but initially I suspected an SQL error.

At this point, I needed to write SQL to verify whether my original SQL was really working correctly.

Due to the approaching deadline for this task and overlapping other tasks, I couldn't immediately write the verification SQL.

Moreover, until receiving advice from a senior, the verification method of "writing verification SQL" didn't even occur to me.

This was because I lacked confidence that my SQL was written correctly, wondering if it was wrong from the start.

So I started by checking the SQL itself.

If I understood what I wanted to achieve with the original SQL, my thinking would have circled to "just write SQL to verify that."

However, at that point, this thought never crossed my mind.

This embarrassing experience finally made me think I need to study SQL properly.

# Finally

Learning from miserable experiences at work.

As a newcomer, people are more forgiving, so I haven't been abandoned yet, but I need to eliminate these gaps by repeating such mistakes now.

Find holes and fill them, fill them.

To do this faster, I need to move quickly and try many things and fail.

This failure is also leading to learning.

I want to make mistakes that are acceptable as a new employee and create a learning cycle.
