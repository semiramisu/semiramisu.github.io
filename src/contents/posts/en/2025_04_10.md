# This Isn't School, It's a Company

**Conclusion: Work backwards from the company you want to join**

About 10 days have passed since company training began.

Today, I thought about the question I had as a student:

"How much knowledge should I have to be advantageous at a company?"

I tried to think about my answer so far.

When I was job hunting, I pushed through with my research achievements.

Therefore, I approached it without any job hunting preparation (aptitude tests or interview preparation).

As a result, I received offers from companies interested in my research field and approach, but I was consistently rejected by companies requiring engineering skills.

Even among companies of similar scale and industry, I keenly felt the difference in abilities they seek from new graduates.

# Different Ways of Living

Fortunately, I think it was lucky that I could join a company that valued my research approach so far.

There are development lessons during the research period, and being taught at the company what others learned through trial and error as students is extremely valuable.

Besides systematic learning, being taught with practical application in mind - how to use it in work - makes the knowledge absorption different.

Of course, I currently can't match colleagues who were heavily into personal development or learned through internships.

That can't be helped.

Thinking about it, being able to learn technology while receiving a salary is something I'm extremely grateful for.

I once admired student entrepreneurship and went to talk to VCs and entrepreneurs (there should be traces of this on X).

Of course I still admire it, but while understanding the difficulty of making money, I'm currently studying society while being careful not to become too domesticated as a company employee.

# To Students

Like me, even if you only did research during your student days, if you can find a company that values that, not doing internships or personal development doesn't necessarily put you at a disadvantage.

On the other hand, to be honest, it's also true that many people are accumulating knowledge through internships and personal development.

Make choices you won't regret when considering the company you want to join or what you want to achieve in society.

In my case, I honestly felt I failed at university entrance exams, so I put effort into research, and as a result, I was able to join my current company.

If you have a university name, use it; if not, I think it's good to sharpen at least one thing.

# Finally

There must be people who find working at a company fun and those who don't.

I'm currently only feeling possibilities, but surely difficult times will come.

Actually, it would be troubling if there weren't difficult times.

For a while, I want to expand possibilities by getting involved in AI and fields that utilize it, both inside and outside the company.
