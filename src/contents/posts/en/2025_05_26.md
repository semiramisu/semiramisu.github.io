# Don't Miss the Chance to Hear from Executives

The other day, as a reward for good results in training, I had the opportunity to have dinner with an executive.

Let me summarize what I learned, within what I can share.

# Skills Required of Engineers

With the recent emergence of AI, the essential skills for engineers are changing.

What struck me was the discussion about C language memory management and managing physical servers.

How many people programming today are coding while thinking about memory management?

How many have experienced managing server racks themselves?

When you think about it, these aren't really "essential skills" for today's engineers.

However, it's true that these were useful knowledge to have just a while ago.

Now we can code without worrying about memory management (though there are situations where we should), and with AWS or GCP, there's no need to prepare servers.

The technologies required of engineers change like this.

AI is entering this natural flow of change.

This makes me think that perhaps programming language selection and skills like writing readable code, which are standard today, might become unnecessary someday.

Writing disposable code through vibe coding might reduce costs and produce better results for digital transformation.

As AI capabilities improve, we create more user-friendly systems and eliminate previous services.

The proportion of maintenance work might decrease.

Thinking this way, I'm re-recognizing the need to fully utilize AI.

First priority: be recognized as a valuable team member quickly!

# Fewer Bold Self-Declarations

What particularly impressed me was the comment that "fewer people clearly declare what they want to do."

As the company has grown, we're no longer in a phase where those with personnel authority know all employees' faces and aspirations.

In this situation, you need to loudly declare what you want to do - even somewhat audaciously - or it won't reach the top.

Even if it reaches them, bland declarations that get buried have no meaning (paraphrased).

However, fewer people make such declarations each year.

Conversely:

1. Declaring makes you stand out!

2. It cuts off retreat and forces you to act!

3. As a result, your abilities grow and more people who resonate with your declaration will help you.

This becomes the flow.

In my case, I tend to step back, so making bold declarations might be better.

# Changes in Excellent Engineers' Side Jobs?

Recently, due to overtime regulations, there are more cases where people want to work but can't.

In this situation, if you want to improve your abilities, do side jobs!

This topic had some delicate aspects, so I'll only share what can be said publicly.

That is: "Aren't side job opportunities for engineers decreasing?"

While there's no statistical backing, there seems to be such an atmosphere.

Possible reasons:

1. With LLM development, general services can be replaced to some extent

2. Increase in services created by small teams combining excellent engineers with AI

3. Unknown

What I personally found interesting was AI's merits and demerits appearing on both sides.

Indeed, Cursor, which I'm using to write this blog, was developed by about 10 people (initially 4) but achieved $100 million in annual revenue in one year.

While those who skillfully utilize and provide AI grow, LLM translation accuracy has improved, making multi-language support natural.

As a result, we might be in a timeline where we're always competing with Silicon Valley's cutting edge.

Additionally, since services can now be created by small teams, there's less need to outsource to external people for side jobs.

If you can proceed with a small team, it's faster to have fully committed personnel.

In this case, rather than finding side jobs, the reality is beginning where launching and experimenting with your own services becomes standard.

# Reconsidering Work

What I particularly felt throughout was:

- "Use the company"

- "Think carefully about how engineers make money"

- "Declare and cut off retreat"

What I can do starting today is make declarations that might seem audacious to my mentor and team members.

Then, use all available AI and company assets to figure out how to create value.

Furthermore, since overtime regulations hinder my growth, I'll have a place for self-improvement through side jobs.

While feeling happy to have joined as a new graduate in a place that affirms working enthusiastically, let me work hard not to get buried.


# Finally

"Have words you can return to within yourself."
