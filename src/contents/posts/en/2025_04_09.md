# Impressions

In a word, it's a self-help book.

A collection of golden sayings from Kenichi Ohmae's past books.

Published in 2011, excerpted from earlier works, but the content is still fully applicable even now with AI development.

Especially the title of Chapter 1: "What's Needed in an Age Without Answers"

In the end, there's never been an age where all answers are clear.

In any era, detailed situations differ, but the essence of problems remains the same.

Think for yourself, hypothesize, verify, and if you find you're wrong, return everything to a blank slate and think from scratch.

Those who keep thinking, keep acting, and don't become fixated can seize fortune.

# How to Apply It

With this book, what's important is how to incorporate it into habits.

There are many golden sayings, so if you think you know them but don't act, or use them without sublimating them into your own words, it's nothing but negative.

So how should I make them my own?

1. How will I apply the golden sayings that caught my attention in my life? Break them down into if-then statements.

2. Create check items, count daily challenge attempts, and think about why I couldn't do something when I had the chance.

3. Think about what I gained as a result of execution.

4. Based on those results, think about what to do next.

Something like that, I suppose.

As a new working professional, this is the optimal timing to update common sense and habits.

While reading other books by Kenichi Ohmae, I want to think about how to make them my flesh and blood and carve out my own path.

# Finally

Next, I'm thinking of reading "Corporate Strategist."

After I finish the books I'm currently borrowing from the library.

I'm only able to do dumbbell training at home right now, so I need to change this habit too.
