# The Difficulty of Surveys

Since training ends this week, there's a survey after each session.

I usually answer with "It was good," but I always wonder:

Does this have any meaning?

From the survey taker's perspective, they probably want to hear participants' opinions and make improvements.

But how many people actually answer honestly, whether good or bad?

Understanding the organizers' challenges, I rarely write negative evaluations.

However, I question whether evaluating something as "good" really has meaning.

When do surveys actually function well...?

I'll probably use surveys in my work in the future, but I felt the need to think carefully and verify them.

# Summary

When I work out in the morning, I don't have time to read, so I have no material for this diary.

Rather than material, I feel like I'm not taking any actions for self-growth besides working out.
