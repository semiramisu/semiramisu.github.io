# People Don't Experience the Real World Itself, But the World Narrated Inside Themselves

I strongly felt this was true.

In reality, even when obvious opportunities are available from others' perspectives, people might miss them thinking "I'm not good enough."

Also, even when people receive advice or hear stories from books or others, they tend to cherry-pick only the parts convenient for them.

Advertising is particularly clear.

Supercar advertisements and specialized magazine displays often feature race queens.

As a result, supercars and race queens become associated in people's minds.

When this happens, these two things overlap and leave an impression in viewers' minds.

The book mentions how Coca-Cola combines happiness with their products.

As a result, drinks handed over saying "Coke" are highly rated, while the same drink handed over without saying anything doesn't taste as good.

Ultimately, people aren't experiencing reality but depend on their assumptions.

This means it's important to penetrate the other person's deeper consciousness with words and advertisements.

Especially when returning to daily life after seeing an advertisement, you need to think about what words and images to choose that will make them suddenly remember, and what impressions to combine with yourself or your product.

Thinking this way, it makes sense that some people won't be convinced even when presented with just facts.

# People Have Blind Spots

This was interesting in the physiological sense of blind spots too.

The point that disappears when you bring the page close to your eyes.

I think it's good to actually try this with the book or similar exercises.

You can understand that there are parts you literally can't see even though they're right in front of you.

If there are blind spots in reality, considering the images that the brain can't process and discards even though light enters the eyes, there are even more blind spots.

It was fun realizing I can't see everything by myself - or rather, being aware that I can't see.

# People Can Only Judge Through Contrast and Relative Evaluation

People can't make absolute evaluations.

When you think about it, it's obvious.

People use numbers to measure effectiveness and to see how much something has improved.

When numbers can't be used, like determining which light is brighter, you can't judge without seeing two lights simultaneously.

Furthermore, with things like smell where there's adaptation, absolute evaluation is difficult.

Thinking this way, when making people choose, you need to make them use relative evaluation.

Combining this with the earlier "People don't experience the real world itself, but the world narrated inside themselves," you need to have the perspective of how to make them relatively evaluate your "thing you want to appeal" as something good in their inner world.

Difficult.

This way, behind "good products sell," there seems to be hidden the fact that "products sell when customers see them as better than what they're comparing them to."

When doing individual business or promoting yourself from now on:

"Understand the other person's inner world, and what will it be compared to?"

Without clarifying this, you can't create a strategy.

Thinking that market research and persona setting are for this purpose, I understand well that this preparation is essential.

Develop listening techniques to listen well, clarify the inner world, and make them relatively evaluate.
At that time, make them recall the image you want to connect with yourself or your product.

# People Judge by Sale Prices

This also relates to relative evaluation.

Ultimately, there's no way to judge the quality of that product.

So they use indicators like price or popularity that can easily be relatively evaluated with other products.

I realized this with Amazon's price tracker.

An extension that shows the price history of products.

You can know when it's best to buy products you're interested in.

While this shows sale timing and allows you to buy at good prices, it lacks the perspective of whether to buy other products.

It's fine after careful consideration, but by deciding on one product, you've shifted from comparing products with different specs to evaluating the easier-to-evaluate price.

Also, just because it's cheap doesn't mean you really need it.

Ultimately, you need indicators for relative evaluation, and price is just one of them.

I want to develop the habit of thinking whether I'm falling into the trap of relative evaluation, escaping to things that are easy to evaluate.

# Summary

This is just the very beginning of the book, but there are many helpful parts.

I need to incorporate the perspective that "I'm experiencing the world narrated inside myself."

There were many times I couldn't understand why others responded in certain ways.

Part of the reason seems to be that my inner world differs from theirs.

Thinking this way, if I can understand that, my world might expand, and I might find business opportunities, dreams, and companions more easily!

To approach that inner world and draw out topics and content that can empathize, I need listening techniques.

Let me study more about listening on D-Lab.
