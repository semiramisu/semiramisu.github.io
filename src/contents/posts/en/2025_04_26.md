# Let's Build Work Assets
Engineer training is approaching its end.

Each team is creating web services and applications.

Since I have no development experience, everything is a new discovery.

I have no idea what backend and frontend are doing, but only respect accumulates saying "That's amazing."

Within this, I'm also thinking about how to close this gap.

Of course, there's no need to surpass others in every aspect.

It's a team precisely because each person's specialty comes together.

However, it's also true that having certain knowledge creates conversation, and new ideas are born from there.

# Let's Build Work Assets

Within this, I've started thinking about how to accumulate knowledge and increase reproducibility.

In an era where AI will answer if you ask.

Rather than just writing the answer as is, I keenly feel it's important to ask AI in a way that provides reproducibility - why this method is used, how it was thought through.

Then things you can understand without asking AI increase, and as a result, reproducible knowledge and code increase.

I was focusing only on output quality, but I felt the need to create an environment to reproduce it.

# Finally

If you don't build assets yourself, you'll remain a newcomer.

Let's engage in knowledge and environmental preparation to continue quality output!
