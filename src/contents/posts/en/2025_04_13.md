# Impressions
1. Psychology of Money
2. How to Use Money
3. Values About Money

The psychology around money was particularly interesting.

You shouldn't think about hourly wages, just being conscious of money reduces kindness, etc.

I've been thinking only about money recently, so I need to be careful.

Especially, I was concerned about every expense because I didn't have money.

This isn't necessarily bad, but if you think too much about money, you can't focus on other things.

I need to think less about money.

# How to Use Money

I agreed with many points about how to use money.

Especially, single people tend to buy things to elevate themselves.

Indeed, recently I've been interested only in things that might upgrade myself a bit, like clothes and shoes.

I originally liked leather goods and thought they were good because they last long.

But this might just be an excuse, and I might have been trying to fill my anxiety.

For now, let me reconsider how I use money and think about whether I can allocate more to experiences.

By the way, what I wanted were Jobs' pants, a Fox Umbrella, leather shoes, etc.

I'm starting to feel it would be better for me to use these as rewards when I achieve something, connecting them to increased productivity.

# Values About Money

I also need to reconsider my values about money.

I think of money as a means for freedom.

This might not be wrong, but I must be sacrificing something because of it.

This connects to what I'm emphasizing and what I'm neglecting.

I need to reflect once and think about what's necessary for the "freedom" I truly want.

Also, how much money should I save? It's not infinite.

I need to specify this upper limit and guideline.

If I decide on a temporary goal, I can reduce guilt when using or saving money, and also reduce waste.

I want to think about this considering potential marriage in the future and the possibility of losing work as AI replacement progresses in the IT industry.

Furthermore, many IT companies nowadays don't have retirement benefits.

This might be because there's a lot of job-hopping in IT, or they might be adding that to salaries instead.

Therefore, when comparing with my parents' generation, I need to consider retirement benefits.

Considering these things, maybe I should create some appropriate asset management site.

# Finally

Apparently, April's salary will be deposited at half rate.

If stock prices stay low, it might be an investment opportunity...
