# Applicable Perspectives

Kenichi Ohmae's books offer many learnings.

They often teach perspectives and ways of thinking I don't have.

Of course, I don't swallow everything whole, but I can broaden my range of thinking.

# Chapter 1

What I learned here was Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's Japanese Archipelago Remodeling Plan.

In this plan, he called for Japan to be developed even if it meant issuing government bonds.

Before and after this call, having a primary balance surplus was normal, and issuing government bonds was considered unorthodox (apparently).

However, Prime Minister Tanaka chose to take on debt to grow Japan, which was expected to have a growing population.

What's now commonplace - issuing government bonds - was an idea that didn't exist at the time, and this plan was newly conceived by imagining the future shape in that era.

Thinking about it this way, Prime Minister Tanaka didn't issue bonds thinking "We've issued bonds before, so let's do it again" based on precedent.

As a perspective I can apply:

- What's the current situation? What investments or measures should be taken? Think from zero base.

I felt this perspective was present.

I'll leave discussions about government bond issuance and MMT to economics professors.

This time I'm only summarizing perspectives that might be useful in my work and private life, so please understand.

There was also an interesting perspective on long-term administrations.

That is:

"Sometimes administrations last long because they're unpopular" (paraphrased)

There are certainly long-term administrations resulting from enthusiastic fan support.

On the other hand, sometimes parties continue long-term administrations because there are no notable opponents.

In companies too, just because they've lasted long doesn't mean we should unconditionally praise them as wonderful.

Well, I think the principles of natural selection differ between for-profit companies and politics.


## Minimum Wage and the Invisible Hand

Another interesting perspective was about minimum wage.

I'm often surprised by the difference in part-time wages between my hometown Ibaraki and current Tokyo.

Apologies for using old hourly rates, but in Ibaraki it's about 900 yen, in Tokyo about 1,300 yen.

Well, there are companies with higher and lower rates in both places.

Since I have friends in my hometown making a living from part-time work, I felt rising minimum wages were good news.

But here was another enlightening perspective.

It's about corporate headquarters functions.

Indeed, from a corporate perspective, if wages can be kept low, they'll open stores in those regions.

As a result, an economy is created there, people in the region are employed, and the entire region prospers.

Also, rent is cheap in rural areas, reducing fixed costs (though cars are necessary).

As a result, people might have more money left over than in Tokyo.

In this situation, what happens if minimum wages rise?

For companies, considering brand image and population density, they'll open stores in metropolitan areas like Greater Tokyo or Kansai.

I think this is true.

If paying exactly the same wages, they should open stores where there are more customers, resulting in no stores in rural areas.

As a result, rural areas might head toward decline.

I didn't have this perspective.

I don't know if this is correct, but I was surprised that I hadn't even considered this possibility.

I felt like I'd been unconsciously poisoned by the idea that:

Higher income = Happiness


# About Chapters 2 and 3

After Chapter 1, the content wasn't something I could digest and apply to daily life.

It contains Kenichi Ohmae's thoughts on the current election system and foreign policy - check it out if you're interested.


# Summary

It's not good to swallow everything an author says.

On the other hand, I think it's a good era when I can learn perspectives I didn't have for free by borrowing books from the library.

Personally, I think books are better than video materials for absorbing and applying knowledge.

Will the age of videos never end...?
