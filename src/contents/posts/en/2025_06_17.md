# The Downside of Morning Workouts

Currently, I'm training at the gym before going to work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

This hadn't been a problem at all until now, but a problem arose starting today.

That is: "My metabolism rises and I can't stop sweating."

Until around May, even though I thought it was hot, the outside temperature wasn't that hot, so there was no real harm.

But suddenly we're having consecutive days over 30 degrees Celsius.

As a result, I can't stop sweating.

Of course, I go home and take a shower, but afterwards I still sweat because my metabolism is elevated.

I need to take urgent measures for this.

Once I'm on the train, it's fine because the air conditioning works, but I can't stop sweating from home to the station and while waiting for the train.

# Should I Use a Gym Near Work?

Since I go to Anytime Fitness, I can also use gyms near my company.

This way, my morning train time would be consistent regardless of whether I go to the gym or not.

However, the problem is clothing.

I'll sweat to some extent, and while showers are available, the problem is what to do with workout clothes.

I wonder what other people do...

If I switch to a gym near work, I could consider Gold's Gym and use other facilities like saunas too.

Well, the price difference is about 6000 yen, so it's not an easy decision.

It would also make it difficult to go to the gym on weekends.

For now, I just want to figure out what to do with workout clothes and enjoy a comfortable gym life as summer really begins.

# Finally

Due to the extreme heat, I've started using air conditioning when sleeping.

Looking at my Apple Watch sleep records, the length of deep sleep changes with and without air conditioning, so if you don't properly manage temperature, you won't recover from fatigue.
