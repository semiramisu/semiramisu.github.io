# The Granularity of Goal Setting

I decided on my half-year goals until September in consultation with my mentor.

I can't share the details, but let me summarize the difficulty of goal setting that I felt during this process.

When you hear "half-year goals," somewhat large goals are expected.

However, if they're too large, they can't be achieved.

Furthermore, goals like "become a good engineer" where different people imagine different outcomes are nonsensical.

This means you need goals that are large and can be evaluated quantitatively.

Moreover, even personal goals are influenced by team situations.

You need to incorporate current team tasks and required abilities while matching them with your desired future state in six months.

What I felt from goal setting is that **goals cannot be created without mentor support**.

New employees don't understand team situations or task weight.

It's thanks to having an excellent mentor who breaks these down well and shows direction.

While there's kindness, you can't rely entirely on it.

What you want to become and what kind of engineer you'll be as a result depends on you.

I'll set goals while utilizing the team and environment in a positive way.

# Finally

To achieve half-year goals, you need to break them down into monthly, weekly, and daily goals and tasks.

When I actually tried this, it became clear that I need to grow considerably every day, and I keenly felt there's no time to waste worrying alone.

Don't just set goals - properly break them down to the daily level.
