## Mindset for Seizing Opportunities

I was wondering if there's a way to seize opportunities, so I watched a video by kensuu.

I once attended kensuu's presentation at a web3 event, so among entrepreneurs, I feel a one-sided sense of familiarity with him.

Everything discussed with Minowa-san in this video was beneficial.

What particularly resonated with me was Minowa-san's point.

To summarize: "You can walk normally most of the time, but sprint at full speed when opportunities come. Opportunities only come once."

# Personal Experience

Looking back on my short life, when things went well, I jumped in without preparation, thinking I would probably fail.

As a result, things worked out more often than not.

I never experienced rejection or embarrassment.

On the other hand, many regrets come from times when I didn't take a step forward, thinking "If an opportunity came this time, there will be another."

Just putting this into words now, memories of past failures to challenge flash through my mind, making me feel sick...

- I have no ability!

- That's why I must step up to the plate

- If I step up to the plate, I'll gain something, so I'll jump at opportunities

- To jump at opportunities, I need to create gaps in my daily life

- There's no such thing as "it's too early for me"

- You progress as you go along

- Have the mindset that a batting average below 10% is normal


# Summary

Use AI to eliminate routine work, secure blank time while jumping at opportunities

As we progress through team development training, differences between myself and others are becoming clear.

Personally, I think if we can implement the required functionality, it's better to throw it to an LLM rather than creating an ML model ourselves.

Wanting to implement by creating your own model without relying on LLMs is just ego - what's needed is the functionality.

But this might be a reflection that I'm neither interested in technology nor have pride in it.

It's both a strength and a weakness.

Let's think about how to use it well.
