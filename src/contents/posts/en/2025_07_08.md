# Morning Exercise

Today I woke up at 4:50 AM due to my usual nightmare.

Since I was up early anyway, I headed to Anytime Fitness for training.

I was surprised to see more than 5 people there at this hour, but I pushed through my shoulder and leg workout.

I only had an hour since I needed to leave the gym by 6 AM, so I could only manage 3 exercises...

However, the best part about morning exercise is being able to take a guilt-free shower first thing in the morning.

I recently cut my long hair quite short and bought the carbonated shampoo I'd been enjoying, so I decided to try it out.

By limiting it to only when I wake up early, the joy was even greater, and the carbonated shampoo's cooling effect seemed to reduce sweating.

As a result, I had a great mood all day and made good progress at work. A task that was expected to take 2 weeks looks like it might be resolved early - possibly within this week!

Morning exercise really does have nothing but benefits.

Since I didn't get much sleep today, I'll probably sleep soundly, and at this rate I might wake up early again tomorrow.

My reading on the train went well too - I started two books: one on logical thinking and another on effect verification.

The effect verification book particularly hit home with its content, making me think "this is what real studying is about."

# Final Thoughts

Mornings are still cool, so if you're going to be active, morning is definitely the time!
