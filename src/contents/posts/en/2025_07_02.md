# Morning Person's Dilemma

July has arrived, and I've been granted 3 days of paid leave!

Before receiving them, I thought "Oh, I get paid even when I rest," but looking at it differently, I've come to think I need to contribute to the company enough to deserve getting paid even when resting.

I heard we can carry over vacation days for 2 years, so for now I'd like to save them up for 2 years and use them for a long trip.

Overseas would be nice, and I'd like to try a cruise ship.

But back to the topic.

My morning routine has become established, and I'm enjoying being able to work at my own pace.

The other day, when I was chatting with colleagues near quitting time at 7 PM, it suddenly became 9 PM.

Since many engineers are night owls, trying to connect with colleagues inevitably means staying late.

I think I need to compensate for these fewer touchpoints somewhere, but I haven't managed to do so yet.

There was also an internal study session the other day, but since it was scheduled to run until around 9 PM, I left partway through.

I wonder if it's best to pack in knowledge during comfortable morning hours at my own pace, and nurture colleague relationships during lunch and such.

That's what I thought today.

While developing technical skills, I also need to build relationship capital.

# Finally

The difference in performance between when I sleep properly for over 7 hours versus under 7 hours is significant.

I declare sleep as my top priority.
