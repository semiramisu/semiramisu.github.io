# Life Goals

I went back to my hometown during Golden Week.

Though it was only for 3 days since I followed the regular calendar.

During these visits, I always make sure to spend time with my grandmother.

Every time I visit, she asks if I have a girlfriend, if I'm getting married, and seems to reflect on her own life.

My answer is always "I don't have anyone" and I stick with that.

I do feel sorry that I can't show her a great-grandchild at this point.

If I can't manage it in the next 4 years, I'll probably stay single.

Well, putting that aside...

There are two things I feel when talking with my grandmother:

- Don't let your mind deteriorate

- Be honest

The importance of these two points.

Honestly, her memory is getting worse year by year.

She often talks about my elementary and middle school days.

Furthermore, she often forgets the names of my schools.

While this can't be helped, she mostly asks about things we talked about yesterday again.

Even after spending two full days together, the conversation content amounts to about 1-2 days' worth.

Most of it is repetition.

On the other hand, she eloquently talks about her own past.

This makes me happy in its own way, and it's interesting as historical stories.

However, I'm always anxious about how much she'll remember about me the next time we meet, wondering if she'll say "Who are you?"

The second point is the importance of being honest.

My grandmother is a person with strong preferences.

When I do heavy work that she can no longer do, she gives detailed instructions.

This itself is fine, and it's okay because we're family, but when I think about the future when she might need care from professional caregivers, I worry that this way of speaking will be troublesome.

I'm humbled thinking that caregivers and nurses are always dealing with such particular, stubborn people.

Watching such people, I felt that having a mindset that respects others' opinions and ways of doing things, not just pushing through your own opinions, will be useful in the future.

Or, if you want to push through your own way until the end of life, you must be healthy enough to take care of yourself until the very end.

# Finally

Being healthy.

Having an attitude that can respect others' opinions as others' opinions.

I learned abilities that connect to both work and life.
