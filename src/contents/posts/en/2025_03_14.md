# Conclusion

I tried an exercise to deepen self-understanding using Gemini and Obsidian.

Thanks to this, what I should focus on from now on has become clear.

# Tools Used

・Gemini API (free)
・Obsidian (note-taking app)

# What Is It?

Obsidian is a note-taking app.

I think it's more convenient than similar Notion because users continuously create and publish extensions.

You can do various things for free, such as checking schedules by linking with Google Calendar and utilizing LLMs.

I'll talk about Obsidian another time.

This time I used the Copilot extension.

Its advantage is that you can have conversations with LLMs and save the content as notes.

Therefore, when digging deep into yourself like this time, you can easily review the results later.

Furthermore, since you can reference past notes, conversations are possible with the LLM understanding you.

# What Did I Do?

I input my current desires and dreams, and had the LLM continuously ask questions to dig deeper with "why?" and "how come?"

Below is an actual consultation I had:

```python
**user**: Please keep asking why? how come?
I want to live without worrying about money

**ai**: Why do you want to live without worrying about money?
What would you do if you could live without worrying about money?
How can you live without worrying about money?

[Timestamp: 2025/03/14 09:05:40]

**user**: Because I have financial anxiety. Due to the weak yen and declining wages in Japan, money worries are constantly following me.
If I could live without worrying about money, I'd like to travel abroad for long periods, like a year.
To live without worrying about money, I want to earn a lot at once and put it into stable asset management. For that, I want to try earning money myself rather than being employed by a company

**ai**: Why do you have financial anxiety?
What specific anxieties do you have about the weak yen and declining wages in Japan?
What are the specific money worries that constantly follow you?

Why do you want to travel abroad for long periods, like a year?
Is there anything else you'd like to do?

Why do you want to earn a lot at once and put it into stable asset management?
Why do you want to try earning money yourself rather than being employed by a company?
Are there no other methods?
```

# Results

Here I input frank content about entrepreneurship, life planning, how to use money, etc., and had them dig deep continuously.

Even when asking completely different questions, the root of my worries seemed to be the same.

Therefore, I found my life biases, ways of thinking to eliminate them, and tasks I need to do.

Consulting with LLMs is recommended because you don't need to prepare a listener and can consult honestly.

If you save all interactions here in Obsidian, you can check them on all devices—smartphone, tablet, and PC—which is convenient and helpful when establishing future policies.

# Finally

When brainstorming startup ideas, if you make it speak harshly, it'll tear you apart, which is perfect for refinement
