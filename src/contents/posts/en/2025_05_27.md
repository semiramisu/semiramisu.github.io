# For Reproducible Work

I made some progress on my first work task.

Well, I still can't see signs of task completion yet.

But I want to celebrate even small progress.

This process took 3 days (while working on other tasks like half-year goal design in parallel).

To shorten the time to complete similar tasks in the future, I did a retrospective.

Let me summarize the content and approach of that retrospective.

# Retrospective Content


1. Write out the overall picture of the task

2. Write out review comments

3. Compile Python scripts that might be useful in the future

## Write Out the Overall Picture of the Task

First, I write out the overall picture of this task again.

Next, looking back, I summarize "where and how" I modified existing programs.

This time there was a lot of content in fields I hadn't touched before, like SQL and dbt, so I didn't understand how things were connected.

Because of this, I took some detours, so I wrote out the direct route to problem-solving as I currently understand it.

## Write Out Review Comments

Next, I write out and organize the review comments I received from my mentor.

I think these comments can be classified into several types:

1. Readability

2. Insufficient understanding of team rules

3. Insufficient code

4. Insufficient understanding of mechanisms


Among these, for reproducible work, they can be classified into two categories:

1 and 2 will be necessary when writing any program in the future.

3 and 4 won't be necessary for all tasks, but they'll be extremely useful for similar tasks.

So I classified and organized the comments I received about these.

Furthermore, I added 1 and 2 as rules to Cursor.

This enables checking whether LLM's auto-generation and checks comply with the rules.

Time-saving is important.

## Compile Python Scripts That Might Be Useful in the Future

Finally, compiling Python scripts that seem reusable.

This time I was mainly writing SQL.

However, the volume was large and exceeded Snowflake's query limit of 1MB.

So I had to decompose the SQL by elements.

Since there are already many elements, manual writing or LLM generation increases errors.

So I was generating SQL code with Python.

This allowed me to batch handle things like uppercase/lowercase and adding/removing suffixes.

I think this Python code can be utilized in future tasks by replacing it with more general-purpose code.

I'll clean up the programs I used this time and accumulate knowledge so SQL writing can be completed faster next time.

# Summary

This time, I worked on SQL writing and understanding mechanisms while thinking about how to speed things up for next time.

I aim to accumulate usable knowledge for speeding up future work.

In the 3 hours before work starts, I'll somehow stock useful parts from the previous day's tasks and aim for time-saving!
