# Diversity in Human Relationships

What kind of people are around you?

In my case, my main relationships are extremely biasedâ€”only male IT researchers.

Because of this, I have absolutely no contact with women, and I only speak to about 3 people per week.

# Cafe Part-time Job

So? I worked a part-time job for about a year that combined hobby and practical benefits.

At a cafe that seemed a bit above my station.

Nearly 90% of the customers were women, and there were foreign customers too, so it was good practice for English service.

Working in food service brought new discoveries:

1. Personality shows in how tables and plates are left after eating
2. How much calculation chefs put into plating
3. The reason for prices I thought were high for cafes

And so on.

Many of the working part-timers were women too, with conversations I wouldn't normally have and word usage different from science boys.

I realized my ability to read between the lines and perceive things is remarkably low.

Apparently, it's not good to take words at face value...

I feel that interacting with people outside your usual attributes broadens your knowledge and clarifies your strengths and weaknesses.

# Finally

I think the privilege of student part-time work is being able to interact with people of attributes you wouldn't meet much as a working adult.

Students, please venture outside your usual communities and have experiences you can only have now.

Personally, I wanted to interact with people I'd never be involved with in the future, like black-suited staff at hostess clubs.

That's my regret?
