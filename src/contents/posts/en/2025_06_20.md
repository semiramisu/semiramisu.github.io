# The Presence or Absence of Morning Activities

Recently, work has been fun and busy, so I've started using morning time for work too.

By work, I mean looking at past seniors' documents or summarizing my efforts from the previous day.

Due to the heat and drinking parties, I could only use mornings for training once last week.

My sleep time has dropped to the 6-hour range, and my concentration is declining.

I felt the backlash from attending work and related drinking parties.

Based on this, I've recently been consciously reading in the office's free space in the morning and intentionally leaving at regular hours.

Perhaps thanks to this, I made progress today and deeply felt it was a good day.

The learning from this is: don't focus only on work.

To prevent my perspective from becoming rigid, I deeply felt I should also put effort into unrelated studies, training, and other activities.

Especially on trains.

Since Kindle doesn't take up space, I'll read more actively.

Also, really create a morning clothes set quickly and go to the office!

If I'm not careful, evaluation time will come, so let's establish a style for achieving results by then!
