# Meeting with a Senior Colleague

The other day, I had the opportunity to directly ask a successful senior colleague at our company about their secrets to success.

I'd like to share what impressed me during that conversation and what I need to put into practice.

This time, I've compiled content that could be useful for people outside of engineering as well.

# Advice

- Have casual conversations about what you want to do and what others are doing

- Understand your uniqueness, declare it publicly, and explore ways to leverage it

- Among the work and opportunities given to you, first choose what you're likely to succeed at

- Start by trying proven methods first

While the last point might be more for engineers, the first three should be useful for many people.


# What Do You Want to Do?

First, let people know who you are as a person.

Then, opportunities will come around to you.

In my case, I have a habit of thinking alone.

But if you're working at a company, there might actually be exciting opportunities that you don't know about yet.

To seize these, you need to tell people around you what you can do and what you want to do.

This isn't about showing off - it's natural.

The company wins by giving work to motivated and capable people, and you win by doing what you want.

To make this happen, I need to interact more with others.

# Understanding Your Uniqueness

This is similar to the previous point.

Understanding what your strengths are.

Once you understand your strengths, you should be able to think of ways to leverage and promote them.

This is necessary to make yourself a person with market value.


# Among Given Work and Opportunities, First Choose What You're Likely to Succeed At

This was also surprising.

Indeed, there might be multiple tasks you should do right now.

In that case, first choose what you're likely to succeed at.

Then, based on those results, the next work will come.

By building up training this way, you might become able to succeed at work you previously thought you couldn't.

Plus, if you're contributing to the company, more work will come.

# Start by Trying Proven Methods First

This might be more for engineers.

When trying something, choose mature technology.

Try working with that technology, and look for the next move based on the results.

With proven methods, there are plenty of countermeasures available.

Using those, you can make your next move.

Get information that serves as a guide before thinking about your next step.

# Summary

Be aware of what abilities you have and communicate them to those around you.

If you just want to work alone, you might as well go independent.

Think carefully about why you joined a company and get others involved.



On my way back to my parents' home during Golden Week, I saw many rice fields being prepared for planting.

I really do love this scenery.
