# After Finishing My First Week as a New Working Professional

My first week of life as a new working professional has ended.

There were only 4 weekdays, so it wasn't really a full week.

The first week was joint training with people from professions other than engineering.

Thanks to this, I was able to reconsider my perspectives and ways of thinking.

Please refer to my previous blogs for details.

# Company Selection is Important

While talking with people from different professions, I reaffirmed the importance of company selection.

Even though our professions were different, I felt there were many commonalities in our "character."

In a positive sense, I got the impression that similar people, or negatively speaking, highly homogeneous people have gathered together.

While this is necessary to run a company smoothly, I thought that as AI continues to rise, we need to consciously create chaos in this environment.

# Finally

What I think after running through the weekdays:

In my case, it's important not to participate in drinking parties and to go to the office or gym early in the morning to use time for myself.

Let's use the morning hours when we can concentrate for ourselves.
