# The Awesomeness of a Book Stand

[![Book Stand](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UoHpzPdiL._AC_.jpg)](https://amzn.asia/d/cvny2L8)

I finally bought the book stand I'd been contemplating for 3 years!

After using it for a week, it's made input overwhelmingly easier, so I'd like to share!

# Good Points About Book Stands

- Raises your line of sight

- Improves posture

- Hands don't get tired

- Makes note-taking easier

In my case, I tend to fall asleep when reading while sitting, so I basically read at a standing desk or while standing.

Then what gets tired are my neck and arms.

If I don't raise the book to eye level, my neck gets tired, but if I raise it, my arms get tired.

It's fine for paperbacks, but it becomes a burden when reading large books or technical books.

Furthermore, when taking notes, I need to insert a bookmark, making note-taking a struggle.

So I bought the book stand I'd been warming to for 3 years.

The reason I hesitated for 3 years was the price.

At about 9,000 yen, if I could substitute with something else, I could buy 5 books!

That's what I thought and hesitated.

However, I decided it would be better to save on book purchase costs by borrowing from the library and increase my reading volume and speed instead.

# Impressions After Using It

My reading speed has increased overwhelmingly.

This is largely because fatigue and body pain unrelated to reading have disappeared.

Furthermore, this book stand has a rotating part that holds the pages - pages turn smoothly when turning them, but the book itself is held firmly.

Additionally, since it's large, it can hold a 14-inch laptop.

It can also be used to raise computer eye level, making it quite versatile.

With this, I can increase my input speed, so I want to keep more reading records on this blog.

# Finally

Items like book stands and standing desks that I hesitated to buy for about 3 years due to high prices have higher satisfaction.

Things bought on impulse often end up unusable later, so I'll stop buying things just because they're "cheap."
