# Asset Management

How is everyone managing their assets?

With the new NISA starting, I think many people have begun regular investing.

I also put most of my monthly salary (previously part-time wages) into regular investments.

Now that I'm a working professional, I've decided to seriously add bonds to stocks for portfolio stability.

I've created my own rebalancing criteria and plan to take it easy.

In this context, there's the question of whether to choose Japanese government bonds, US bonds, or US bond ETFs.

Looking only at yields, US bonds are the clear choice.

However, currency risk comes with the weak yen.

While I'll consider this area a bit more...

# Asset Progression of Stocks, Bonds, and Cash Deposits

General asset management simulations only target stock investments.

- Monthly investment amount

- Annual yield

- Investment period

This is the type where you input these and it displays results.

However, there's no simulation that adds bonds and cash deposits to this!

If it doesn't exist, create it!

So I made it with Python.

# How to Use
On the left side, you can set investment amounts and yields for stocks, bonds, and cash deposits to simulate management.

That's all there is to it.

The yield calculation method results in lower values compared to other sites.

According to the LLM, this is because "it multiplies the previous month's assets by the monthly yield before adding the current month's investment amount."

So it might be due to this different addition method.

For personal use, having lower results isn't a problem, so I'm leaving it as is.

# Summary

In an era where you can create the services you want with a bit of knowledge.

What each person creates to enrich themselves varies.
