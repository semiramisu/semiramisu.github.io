# Start and Reproducibility

After being assigned, there's quite a bit to learn.

Fortunately, as a data scientist, I think it's less compared to other professions.

I'm learning while getting hands-on experience with data structure, content, and where everything is located.

During this process, what I'm careful about is having reproducible learning.

I'm working while thinking I need to establish understanding procedures that can be used even when jumping into a new environment next time.

## What is a Reproducible Start?

In my mind, I'm conscious of what the team expects from me and why I was given this task first.

I ask directly about what's expected.

On the other hand, I think deeply about why this particular task came first.

This task probably came to help me understand the data and learn how the team works.

Then, what are the parts I need to grasp?

Conversely, what points don't need attention now but will need to be understood in the future?

And so on.

It's the perfect timing to grasp thinking frameworks that can be used when assigned to new tasks or when changing jobs.

Well, right now I'm struggling more with troubleshooting problems that aren't working well.

But I might be happy that I can eat from data analysis that I love, at least for now.

Since I think I need to gain experience before being replaced by LLMs, I'm working/learning almost half the day.

I need to be able to produce results at work soon.

# Finally

In the end, to gain experience and ensure reproducibility, you just have to do it.

That means facing the computer for 12 hours a day, and weekends are similar.

This means private life is really impossible for 5 years.

That's how a 30-year-old single person is created, so I don't think I can contribute to countermeasures for the declining birthrate.

I'll be on the side expecting others to raise children.

Thank you.
