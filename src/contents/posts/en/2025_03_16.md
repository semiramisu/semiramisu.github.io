# Differences in What We Expect from AI

I watched a video featuring everyone's favorite Mikitea-sensei.

In it, there was a point made by the conversation partner Emin-san that made me think "I see."

To summarize, he wants AI to do physical labor that he wouldn't want to do himself, like construction work or dishwashing.

Creative work like drawing should be done by humans.

(I hope there's no misinterpretation)

# The Gap Between Reality and Wishes

When doing research and activities using AI and LLMs now, we're actually moving in the direction of replacing creative parts.

Video generation, music generation, image generation, etc.

But certainly, what we want is a replacement for the tedious daily activities.

Currently, this kind of replacement is difficult because robot performance hasn't improved enough and unexpected things happen frequently.

Labor costs are cheap, and it's clearly cheaper and faster for humans to do it.

Looking at the AI field around me, few people seem to be working on this part.

If we were to replace these tedious tasks, how should we do it?

Why do we feel they're tedious in the first place?

I felt that if we could dig into these fundamentals, it could become a business.

# Conclusion

AI perspectives from people in different positions are perfect for avoiding mental dead ends!
