# The Heat Has Arrived

Starting today, it's suddenly gotten hot, making me think I need to completely change my clothes and belongings.

Not being used to the heat, I had to turn on the air conditioner right away.

I'll think positively that I can sweat without going to a sauna.

On the other hand, trains are getting hot too, making it the season when riding them becomes tedious.

While I think about working comfortably from home, I feel every day that I need to learn more about work to make sufficient progress at home.

# How to Spend Weekends

Today, I successfully completed the second stage assessment for my driver's license, with the practical test coming next week.

If I pass that, I need to take the written test within a year.

At this rate, I calculate I'll get my license by July, but I'm thinking about how to use my weekends after that.

It might be good to get a motorcycle license while I still remember everything, or use the time for self-study for weekday work.

How do other engineers spend their weekends?

At our company, AWS and GCP are covered by benefits, so it might be good to use these to get certifications.

A senior advised me to just learn what I use in work.

On the other hand, considering internal transfers, side jobs, entrepreneurship, or job changes, it wouldn't hurt to become strong in cloud technologies.

There's talk out there about playing on weekdays.

However, seeing many people complaining about the world and themselves, I wonder about following that advice these days.

So I'm thinking of using it as an opportunity to study so weekday work goes more enjoyably.

First, AWS certification, then I'm thinking of starting with studying how to migrate existing machine learning programs from pandas to polars.

I might need to become stronger in programming itself, understanding why processing becomes overwhelmingly faster and how to do it.

Additionally, security will be an issue when starting a business.

Let's study to become strong in that area too!

# Summary

How do many working adults spend their weekends?

Well, at this rate I'll really become a workaholic, but that can't be helped.

First, I want to catch up with others by getting through the numbers.

P.S. I sincerely hope services that let you listen to books like Audible become cheaper.

I'm currently using Kindle's read-aloud feature, but I want to find better methods.
