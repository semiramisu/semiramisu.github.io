# Distance Thinking

The fighter who serves as a reference for my life - that's what Shinya Aoki represents to me.

In a recent YouTube video, he made a striking comment about "the culture of professional wrestling and martial arts."

To summarize, the message was: it shouldn't become a fad, we want it to become culture.

As someone who's grown tired of today's attention-seeking culture and has stopped looking at social media and the internet, this resonated deeply with me.

Well, it might also be because I'm contrarian and think if everyone knows something, there's no need for me to know it too.

I mean, if others know it, why should I waste my time learning about it...

Let's set aside that compatibility for now.

There's a lot in this book I can relate to.

## Distance with Family

Being too close to family can sometimes cause problems.

"Family" consists of people who share common interests, who you meet when you want to meet, and talk to when you want to talk.

So there's no need to lie, and conflicts either don't arise or, if they do, don't affect your personal life.

You could say social media has made it easier to create relationships with this kind of distance, or maybe not.

People around me who I think are good at building their "family" use social media well.

They share what they love, share themselves, and gather their family around them.

Moreover, having families in different fields means they don't get stuck in relationship problems.

Those who aren't doing well seem to have damaged their mental health from being tossed around in anonymous storms on social media.

This might be especially true for young people.

Fortunately for me, partly because of needing material for this blog, I've increased my reading and meaningful relationships.

As a result, I've washed my hands of social media and games.

I only played one smartphone game to begin with, but now I'm just a login warrior.

(The fear of breaking my login streak might already be an addiction though)

Thinking about it this way, I'm able to use my time for personal growth now, and perhaps the relationships with people who benefit me are themselves my "family."

## Status

Perhaps because I spent my student years in the baseball club, I tend to be conscious of status too.

While pushing this way of thinking on others causes problems, I find myself aware of status.

Status has nothing to do with age.

When I dabbled in theater, there were younger people who could captivate audiences far better than I could.

Those people had higher status than me in theater.

Status seems to reflect how seriously someone has engaged with their craft.

The subject can be anything, but it must be something that accumulates.

Recently, it feels like many businesses focus on stealing others' time and robbing them of time for self-improvement.

If we don't resist others' marketing and market ourselves instead, we'll degrade into mere talkers who only complain about others and the world.

## Is Loneliness Scary?

Loneliness - you could say it's both decreased and increased.

On trains, everyone's drowning in the internet sea with earphones and smartphones.

Looking at just that, they're not lonely.

There are many people on the internet, watching the same content.

On the other hand, train cars are full of isolation.

No one's interested in others, bodies are on the train but minds are absent.

Everyone there is isolated.

It might be fine(?) for commuting, but some people look at their phones even while talking with friends.

At that moment, that person disappears from that place.

They become lonely.

How many people can properly use loneliness as time to face themselves?

Being able to tame loneliness and use it as our catalyst might be our privilege.

In that one aspect, I might be in a privileged class.


# Finally

Face yourself in times of loneliness.

To secure time for myself, let's reduce time with non-family.
